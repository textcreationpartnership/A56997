            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He pretended Parliament of <hi>England</hi> having their Agents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>United Provinces</hi> about conditions of an offensive and defensive warre, my resolution was to have set out this Remonstrance in the <hi>Dutch tongue</hi> for the satisfaction of those <hi>Provinces;</hi> but the treaty ended almost as soone as I began to actuate my resolution: whereupon I altered my purpose, and have now set it out in <hi>English</hi> for the satisfaction of your owne Subjects, hoping the truth beeing
<pb facs="tcp:50355:3"/> here clearly illustrated, may have some effect upon their <hi>Consciences,</hi> which can not but have great sway over them in ordering and directing their Actions. Experience teacheth that most men act lesse bouldly and resolutely, (especially where their lives must be engaged) when they act against their <hi>Conscience,</hi> then when they are persuaded of the lawfulnesse and justice of their cause. There hath been more blood spilt by civill warre in your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> dominions within the space of ten yeares, since those pernicious <hi>principles</hi> touching the <hi>Supreamacy of the People</hi> and <hi>lawfulnesse of resistance</hi> have been instilled into mens mindes by some who fetched their doctrine from Hell to furnish the world with tragedies, then formerly in an Hundred. I conceive the nearest and readiest way to reforme such un-christian practices, is to reforme the <hi>Conscience,</hi> although I deny not but more sharpe and violent remedies must also be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: for some have lost all sence of <hi>Conscience,</hi> whome your <hi>Majesty,</hi> I hope, assisted by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty providence of God, shall reforme by the <hi>Sworde.</hi> This is that which Religion calls for
<pb facs="tcp:50355:3"/> at your hands, now oppressed by such a multitud, and confused swarme of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> that I should thinke it impossible for so many men of severall Religions to live together in unitie, did not the <hi>Likenesse</hi> of their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> reconcile their affections, as much as their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Religion can alienate and estrainge them. And this is that which all your faithfull Subjects pray for, who desire nothing more then to see your <hi>Majesty</hi> seated in your <hi>Royall Throne,</hi> and able to protect them from the insolencies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, who make their will their law, disposing as freely of mens lives and fortunes, as if they had <hi>created</hi> them and given them their <hi>Beeing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a rule in <hi>Opticks,</hi> when a darke body is greater then a light to which it is directly opposed, it casteth a shaddow <hi>in infinitum:</hi> Such a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (if the continent were capable of an infinite shaddow) will the darke body of the Rebells cast upon the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> whilst it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed between your <hi>Majesty</hi> and your loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, depriving them both of your favourable <hi>Aspect,</hi> and of your <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:50355:4"/> which they can looke for nothing but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of their present miseries: for should the Rebells prevaile and prosper in their designes, what else can be expected, but that which is wrested from others by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Injustice?</hi> But whilst they wade in <hi>blood</hi> to places of preferment and command, the Lord shal overthrow them in the middest of their course, as he overthrew the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians</hi> in the <hi>red sea;</hi> I usurpe not the name of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> but I speake as one beleeving God to be a faithfull observer of his promises: He will not alwayes be deafe to the prayers and complaints of those that are oppressed, but send them delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his due time, and supply your <hi>Majesty</hi> with all things necessary both to vindicate your owne Rights, and free your People from their oppression.</p>

            <head type="sub">The beginning, rayse, and progresse of the rebellion raysed by the pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Principles whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to justify their proceedings. The Questions that shall be discussed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Looke upon the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of England if the lawes might be restored to their ancient dignity and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as inferiour to none in the world Parliaments whilst the King and people have acted in their severall spheres, and not invaded the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50355:6"/> of on another, have alwayes beene the surest meanes under God to unite their affections together, and to prevente those dangers which by their mutuall discord must of necessity have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both. Some are so rash as to affirme that all transactions, negotiations, and accords betweene Kings and subjects ought to be interdicted, not onely depriving subjects of the light and favours which they should receive from their Prince, but Princes also of many commodities which they may receive by capitulating with their subjects in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, where the whole kingdome being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, eyther in person, or by representation, may give the King, and receive from him againe, such reciprocall testimonies of love, that he may be assured his people seeke nothing more then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his life, honour, and Royall dignity; and they, that their King endeavoureth no lesse to encrease and maintaine the liberty, riches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of his people. And I am confident the last Parliament had beene as great a blessing to the land as ever any was in former ages, had not the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, avarice, and mallice of some interrupted the course of the lawes. But for this factious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly which hath a longe time called themselves a Parliament, it is a disturber of the Kingdoms peace, an enemy and destroyer of the people; and if we looke upon their actions in their beginning, in their rayse, and in their progresse, they may seeme
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50355:6"/> to have had alwayes a formall opposition to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and to have acted by some occult and specificall quality not common to other Christians. There was endeed at the first beginning of the Parliament, much murmuring and discontent amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, partly caused by monopolies and the unusuall taxation of shippmoney, and partly by the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings of the Starre-chamber and High Commission, whereby divers were often oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Here the enemies of the commonwealth, finding a spacious overture to enter into this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, began to act their partes, and being too provident to loose such an advantage, laboured to exasperate the mindes of the people, and to stirre up those evill humours which began already to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And although his Majesty offered all just sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for what was past, and the best security themselves should in reason require that the like disorders might for ever after be prevented, yet these turbulent and factious spirits, being men of broken fortune, and hoping to heale themselves by the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of others, opposed all such motions, and would needs themselves become chirurgions to the state; and as chirurgions are wont to smooth and stroake the partes which they resolve shall bleede, so they began to smooth and stroake the people, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them a new light in matters of religion, and that they would remove the grievances, and swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the evills which afflicted the commonwealth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50355:7"/> although in stead of removing and sweetning them, they have almost made them incurable. By these perswasions mixed with many pretences of religion they procured the people to meete together in great multitudes, and in a tumultuous manner to assault divers of the Lords as they were going to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to drive them backe againe, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to speake in the house when their speech was most necessary for the service of the kingdome. Although it was easy for his Majesty to discover their intentions, yet the love he bare his people made him to dissemble it, and to give way to their proceedings, hoping they might in time be brought by his favours to mitigate and correcte their furious practices; but finding at last that his patience served for nothing else but to fortify and encourage them in their mallice, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe obliged to take such wayes as he judged most convenient to stope the course of their proceedings, the continuation wherof was like to bring so many mischiefs to the commonwealth: and seeing it was like to be prejudiciall to the safty of the people as well as to his owne to stay longer in a place where there was neyther security for his person, nor liberty for any other then those factious persons to vote according to the dictats of their owne reason, he was forced to withdrawe himselfe from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to avoyde the pernicious effects of those mens counsells which were resolved the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50355:7"/> should sinke rather then themselves not obtaine those places of command and profit which they aymed at. The King being gone it was not to be wondred if they which in his presence had the bouldnesse to weave such pernicious designes against the state, should in his absence endeavour to corrupte the fidelity of his subjects and frame new practices to stirre up the people to rebellion, for having the citty of London wholy at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they neyther wanted means nor opportunity to drawe the people to their faction, who by such artificiall divices as they used were easy to be insna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: They tould them that by resisting the King they should not be rebells, but an army authorised by those which were depositaries of the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that this resistance was an inspiration from heaven which promised the restauration of their ancient liberties that had beene so often violated by the King: They made them beleeve that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King and the whole commonwealth would be brought into confusion if they did not vigorously oppose those disorders were growing upon them, and remove those evill counsellors from the King that did mislead and seduce him; and withall they entred into a league and covenant with the people to preserve and defende the Kings Majesties person and authority together with the liberties of the kingdome, assuring them they had no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50355:8"/> just power and greatnesse. They enticed some by these divices, and compelled others to fight against their consciences, thinking to strengthen themselves by a multitude, or at least to make their owne ruine more famous by the ruine of so many others. But it pleased God they should prevaile for a time; and now we see the effects contrary to those words and promises which were so solemnly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to the whole kingdome, and that by calling God a witnesse to the syncerity of their intentions: for they have not only diminished his Majesties just power and greatnesse, but most traiterously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his life, and that after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended so farre as to satisfy all their unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demands, which fact of theirs althougt it hath beene masked with many specious pretences, and coloured with the fairest shewes of justice, yet was it the most execrable murder that ever was committed next that of our saviour Christ, and his ambitious judge hath gained this, that next PILAT BRADSHAW of all such judges shall by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity be esteemed the chiefe. This murder of the King as it was most unjust, so was it also most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable considering the present disposition of the kingdome, whose strength being already too much weakened and attenuated, ought not to have beene further wasted and consumed by renewing the warre which the death of the King did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. But such motions could worke nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50355:8"/> those which had long before resolved to make all other considerations give place to profit and ambition; the people abused themselves whilst they thought this factious assembly would be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and tender of them then of the King: for they have not onely brought a new warre upon them which might have beene avoyded, dashinge them all against one another, but have also themselves many wayes barbarously afflicted and destroyed them: they have made the scaffold, the gibbet, the prison, and the grave, the common places of their rendevous, and those which they have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by their cruelty, they devoure by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable avarice; whilst they declayme against Kings for oppressing the people by unjust taxations, they have themselves, as hath beene computed by many, squeesed more in one yeare from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth then all the Kings of England have done since the conquest. The lawfull Magestrates are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the liberty and honour of their functions; and such as are the greatest enemies to justice are set up in their places; some are bereft of their estates, others driven out of the Kingdome and forced to seeke a forraine ayre, where they may breath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re freely then in their owne: The whole Nobility, Cleargy, and Commonalty walke desolatly and mournefully up and downe, being no more like the men they were, then the skinnes of sacrificed beasts are like their living bodies. And after all these
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50355:9"/> indignities offered to the King and people, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoure contrary to the lawes to alter the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and to pull up the very foundation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, calling their new frame and structure a Free Estate, and themselves the keepers of the freedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of England: Thus having guilt over this Idoll of their owne fancy, they force all men to fall downe and worshipe it; they whose vertue oblige them to refuse, are cast into a furnace hotter then that of Babylon. Seeing the body of the Kingdome devoured thus to the very entrailes, I could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horrour behould such a miserable carkasse so rent and torne in every parte, nor could I satisfy mine owne conscience if I should not endeavour according to my poore abilities to oppose the rage and fury of these men which are growne so fatte with the blood and spoile of others: My intention therefore is reserving matters of fact for another place to speake here of matters of right, and to shew the injustice of their cause, and discover the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of all those Principles, whereby they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to justify their proceedings, not doubting but I shall so farre convince the understanding of all those that shall read this insuing discource, that they shall not hereafter enter into any combination with the rebells or continue with them in case they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engaged, except their hearts be hardened so farre as they dare act in matters of such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contrary to their consciences.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50355:9"/>
            <p>The Principles and grounds whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to justify this present warre against the King are two; First they say that it is lawfull for the people to resist their soveraigne and supreame governours by force of armes in case they be Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and bent to subvert the lawes and religion established, or by illegall proceedings invade the lives, estates, or liberties of their subjects. But there is some disagreement amongst them in the restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and limitation of their Principle; for some give free scope and liberty to all privat persons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and with their swords in their hands to defende their lives and estates against the unjust invasion of all Kings and governours whatsoever. Others do a little stint the people and limit the bounds of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, permitting none to have that power but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat magistrates, or the people collectively taken and their substitutes in Parliament. Yet these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with the same particular instances brought by the others, alledging little besyds par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples, as the example of David who as they say would have resisted Saul if occasion had beene offered; The example of the Priestes, who, as they say assaulted Uzziah, and such like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of particular men, which were neyther the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple collectively taken, nor their substituts in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor yet the greater part subordinat Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. This is their first Principle, which yet some of them dislike, confessing it to be against
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50355:10"/> the Lawe of God, and to tend directly to the ruine and subversion of government: these have thought upon an other way how to make good their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and proceed upon another Principle, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely that supream jurisdiction belongs to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the King they say is <hi>major singulis</hi> but <hi>minor universis,</hi> greater and hath more authority then any one of his subjects taken by retaile, but taken in the grosse his subjects are greater and have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re authority then he; and these agree altogether in this that they teach all authority to be originally in the people <hi>tanquam in primo subjecto creato</hi> as in its first subject immediatly under God, and from them translated to Magistrates; Kings they say were promoted to that authority by the adoption of the people, which did voluntarily submitte themselves and communicate their authority to those which they thought most capable to defend them, and to administer justice. <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> affirmeth that even those Kings vvhich vvere appointed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by God himselfe received their authority from the people, vvho might have refused them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding they vvere annointed by God and designed unto that office, their free choice being no vvayes restrayned or limited by that designation. <hi>It is apparent</hi> sayth he <hi>that the Iudges and Kings of the Israelites were not properly hereditary but oft elective by the people:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Kingdomes page 124.</note>
               <hi>and though God did sometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly nominat the persons of those that should
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50355:10"/> reigne over them, as is apparent by Saul, David, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam, Iehu, others; yet the people did constantly confirme, make them Kings, and gave them their Royall authority, none being made Kings by divine appointment, but such as they willingby accepted, approved, confirmed for their Kings; Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious designation being but a preparative to their voluntary free (not restrayned or limited) election.</hi> Yet these are divided amongst themselves about the extent and latitude of the povver that may be translated; for some of them say that the rights of soueraignitie belonge to the people by the law of nature, and are so essentiall to them that they can not be seperated or divided from them; they can not be taken avvay by conquest, they can not part vvith them by consent, but under vvhat forme of gouvernment soever they live, by vvhat means soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver established and set up, they have still reserved in them a supreame jurisdiction over all Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, by which they are authorised to give a legall judgement upon all their actions, and to resume againe their whole authority when they shall see oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, making a circle in government, and granting a power in Magestrates to judge and governe the people, and also in the people to judge and governe their Magistrates. So that by their opinion not only the people of England, but the people of all other Kingdomes and commonwealthes have authority over their Magestrates to judge juridically whether
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50355:11"/> their actions be just, and in case they finde them not such, to deprive them of all authority, to punish them with death or otherwise as they shall thinke it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Others on the contrary side say that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may loose the rights of soveraigntie by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, or parte with them by consent, so that they shall not reserve to themselves supreame jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over their Magestrates to judge juridically whether their actions be legall or illegall; but the people of England, they say, have not <hi>de facto</hi> parted with their authority in such a full degree, but are supreame by the lawes of the land, or at least coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate with the King; for at the first coalition of the government by paction and agreement made with the King they reserved to themselves a parte in the rights of soveraigntie which they still hould by law. This is their other Principle as destructive to government as the former, and the authors and maintainers of them both agree well enough in their end, that is to stirre up the people to rebellion: onely, they of the first rank would perswade them they may lawfully doe it by way of selfe preservation, and they of the second, by way of jurisdiction. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende now by Gods assistance to examine these mischievous Principles, and to discover as well the falsity of them as the dangerous consequences that flow from them, which I hope to performe with such clearnesse, and evidence that the most hare-brainde sectaries amongst them shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50355:11"/> if they will but read that which shall be alledged against them.</p>
            <p>Now that I may proceed in opening and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the truth with the better methode, I will divide the matter I am to handle into two partes; In the first part I will speake of supreamacy, and here I will shew that the King alone is the only supreame head and governour of the Kingdome of England, and that all the people and their deputies in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well collectively taken, as severally, are his subjects and not coordinate with him: In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part I will speake of resistance, and there I will shew that the supreame Magestrates and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of any Kingdome or commonwealth may not by their subjects be resisted by force of armes upon any pretence of tyranny or misdemeanour or upon any other cause or pretence whatsoever. I will beginne with supreamacy, because they endeavour now chiefly to purge themselves from the murders and injustice which they have committed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the people, whose supreamacy they say is sufficient to warrant their proceedings. At the first they denied not the supreamacy of the King, but as the keepers and guardians of it they raysed an army against him by vertue of his owne authority, but having seised upon his person and imprisoned him, it was then more conducible to their ends to avouch the supreamacy of the people: but whosoever have the title, they exercise the power themselves, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50355:12"/> as before they rebelled against the King, so now they murder and oppresse the people by pretence of their owne authority, which as their Deputies in Parliament they intend to manage as long as they can finde means to defend and uphould their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now although this pretended Parliament are no more deputies of the people of England, then the <hi>Banditi</hi> are deputies of the people of Italy, who if they had as great a power would soone have as great a right as they to governe under that pretence, yet for the present we will suppose them such and examine only their Principle by which they labour to supporte their cause, that is the supreamacy of the people; and first I will shew that the people and their deputies in Parliament are neyther supreame nor coordinate with the King by the lawes of the land, as some of them say; secondly, that they are not supreame by the lawes of nature, as others; thirdly, that the people never had in them any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or jurisdiction at all which they could give or resume againe upon occasion, as they generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; and these particulars I intende to handle in three questions.</p>
            <p>The first question shall be, whether the people and their deputies in Parliament be supreame and above the King or coordinate with him by the lawes of the land.</p>
            <p>The second, whether the people and their depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Parliament be supreame by the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50355:12"/> and have alwayes reserved a juridicall power of judging their magistrates, whether their actions be just, and of resuming authority in case they be not.</p>
            <p>The third whether authority be originally in the people and translated by them to Kings and other supreame magistrates, or in the Kings and other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame magistrates themselves immediatly from God <hi>tanquam in primo subjecto creato,</hi> as in the first created subject.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first Question that shall come into consideration is whether the people and their deputies in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be supreame and above the King or coordinat with him by the Lawes of the land. The pretended Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50355:14"/> affirme the two houses to be coordinate with the King in the rights of soveraigntie: for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of England, they say, is a mixed Monarchy, and this mixture is in the povver and rights of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty themselves, so that the King alone hath not full and plenary authority to performe all acts requisite to government, but there is in the Monarchy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of severall povvers belonging to severall estates, vvhich being mixed together make up one vvhole and intire povver, and those severall estates one supreame head of the commonwealth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some of them are so liberall as to allow the King a primity of share in this coordination: yet others say that the superiority belongs to the tvvo houses, the King being greater then any one of the members of Parliament, but lesse then the two houses collectively taken, who in the legislative povver, vvhich is one of the principall rights of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, have a greater interest then He, in whose breasts alone remaineth the finall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lavve; for they deny the King to have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice, as if his sitting in Parliament vvere a ceremony and meere formality, and not an acte of Majesty and Iurisdiction. This foundation, as I thinke, was first layd by the fuller Answerer, but the Treatiser, the reverent Divines, and divers others have added a superstructure to it of many fine and new inventions of their owne, which are not needfull to be here related, because they alter not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50355:15"/> the state of the Question; for they all affirme the tvvo houses to be coordinate vvith the King in the rights of soveraigntie, and the mixture of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Monarchy to be in the power it selfe. I will set downe their assertions in the fuller Answerers owne wordes. <hi>Before we judge</hi> sayth he, <hi>of what a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can doe in England, it will be needfull to know what kind of government this of England is, we are therfore to know that England is not a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply subordinative and absolute, but a coordinative and mixt Monarchy; this mixture or coordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the very supreamacy of power it selfe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Monarchy were not mixt: all Monarchies have a mixture or composition of subordinate and under officers in them, but here the Monarchy or highest power it selfe is compounded of three coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate estates, a King, and two houses of Parliament.</hi> And againe a little after he sayth, <hi>But you l' say, what? is not the Parliament subordinate to the King? Are they not all subjects? I answer, the Parliament can not be sayd properly to be a subject, because the King is a part, and so he should be subject to himselfe: no nor are the two houses without him subjects, every member</hi> seorsim, <hi>taken severally, is a subject, but all</hi> collectim <hi>in their house are not.</hi> In his answer to Doctor Ferns reply he addeth further. <hi>Although every one and all the members are subjects, the houses can not properly be sayd to be subject and coordinate too; they are the two</hi> membra dividentia, <hi>which must
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50355:15"/> at no hande admit coincidence: nay tho' all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as partes and put them together too are subjects, yet all the partes of a whole taken all together are not equall to the whole, the order, site, relation, unîon of the partes, whence the formality of the whole results, being still yet wanting.</hi> These are the phantasies of the pretended Parliamentarians, which are so grosse and contrary to law, that the fuller Answerer seems to me to have beene in a dreame, when his heade was first impregnated with such conceptions, as also to have done very improvidently in making the site, relation, order, and union of the members necessary to his coordination; for although I know not what site and relation the members may have had amongst themselves, yet I am sure there hath not beene so much order and union amongst them as will lift them out of the condition of subjects, and make them coordinate with his Majesty.</p>
               <p>I say therefore in opposition to these phantasies, first, that the King alone is by the lawes of the lande the only supreame head and governour of England, and that the people and their deputies in Parliament taken both <hi>collectim</hi> and <hi>seorsim</hi> as well <hi>collectively</hi> as <hi>severally</hi> are his subjects and not coordinate with him: there is no mixture at all in the rights of soveraigntie; for in respect of the power it selfe, the Monarchy is absolute, simple, pure, independent, without prophanation of outward mixture, the King alone without further influence from the two
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50355:16"/> houses having full power and authority to doe or cause to be done all actes of justice, so that what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and authority soever the two houses have in making lawes or in the exercise of any other acte of power, they have it by derivation from him. The King alone makes lawes by the assent of the two houses, and if the two houses are sayd at any time to make lawes, it is by a deligate power and authority communicated to them from him, and not by any power and authority which they have radically in themselves.</p>
               <p>Secondly I say that the King alone is not onely invested with all the rights of soveraignty, but hath them also so inseperably annexed to his Royall person by the lawes of the lande, that they can not be separated from him by any act of Parliament, by any civill constitution, or pragmaticall sanction, by any law, or ordinance whatsoever; but in case the King himselfe should improvidently by acte of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament agree to any thing tending to the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Royall dignity, it is then in the power of the common law to controule such a statute, and to make voyd all such actes as tende to the degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more such as tende to the annihilation of Majesty. Having thus opened the state of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, I will novv proceede to demonstrate the truth by statutes, by common lavv, and by reasons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the lawes and customes of the land.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Kings supreamacy in generall shewed by the statutes of the land.</head>
               <p>I Could both from Saxon and divers other lavves and antiquities shevv the Kings of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to have ruled more absolutely, and to have anciently exercised a larger jurisdiction, then hath of later yeares been exercised or chalenged by their successours: but because many immunities and priviledges have been granted to the subjects since their times; I vvill therfore confine my selfe to such statutes as have beene made since the giving of the great charter. And to avoyd tediousnesse I will omit many statutes wherin the King is by both houses collectively taken acknowledged to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50355:17"/> for they frequently in the statutes stile him <hi>Our gracious soveraigne Lord the King. Our dreadfull soveraigne Lord the King.</hi> I will likewise omitte many others wherin they acknowledge themselves to be his subjects, and that when they were in their site, relation, order, and union, in which posture the fuller Answerer fancies them to be coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate: for such expressions run through divers sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, <hi>Most humbly beseech your most excellent Majesty your faithfull and obedient subjects the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the commons in this your present Parliament assembled. In their most humble wise shewen unto your Royall Majesty your loving subjects the Lordes spirituall and temporall, and the Commons of this present Parlament assembled.</hi> I will only alledge such statutes as have been made on purpose to declare to whome supreamacy and all power and jurisdiction belong: for there hath beene divers actes of Parliament made to that ende upon severall occasions wherein the Kings suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy hath been acknowledged and confirmed vnto him. In the foure and twenty yeare of Henry the eight an act was made that no appeales should be used but within the Realme: the reason alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Statute is because the King alone is the only supreame head of the realme, and is furnished with plenary and intire power to doe all actes of justice. <hi>Where by divers sundry old authenticke Histories and Chronicles it is manifestly declared and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50355:17"/> expressed that this Realme of England is an Empire, and hath so beene accepted in the world, governed by one supreame head and King, having the dignity and Royall estate of the imperiall crowne of the same: unto whome a body politique, compact of all sortes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of people divided in tearmes and by names of spiritualty and temporalty beene bounden and owen to beare next to God a naturall and humble obedience, he being also institute and furnished by the goodnesse and sufferance of Almighty God with plenary, whole, and intire power, preheminence, authority, preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and jurisdiction, to render and yeald justice and finall determination to all manner of folck resiants or subjects within this his Realme.</hi> This cleare testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Kings supreamacy, is thus eluded by the fuller Answerer. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Wee see then</hi> sayth he, <hi>what is meant by governed by one supreame head, such a one as is able to doe all actes of needfull justice, which the King in his naturall capacity can not doe (he can not make a law) it must therefore be understood in his full and intire politique capacity, which takes in law and Parliament; nor can it be sayd that by those wordes a body politique compact of all sortes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Parliament is properly meant, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at large.</hi> The summe of his Answer is this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> that in this Statute by the King not the King alone, but the King and the two houses of Parliament are to be understood, and so although he would have the Kings power to be lesse, yet to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50355:18"/> he will have his name to signify more then it did before. But this is nothing else but the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his owne braine; for if in any place the word <hi>King</hi> could signify the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two houses of Parliament,</hi> yet in this it must of necessity signify the <hi>King</hi> alone:<note place="margin">35. H. 8. cap. 1.</note> these words <hi>having the dignity and Royall estate of the Imperiall crowne of the same,</hi> can have reference to no other. Besids in this Answer he contradicts his owne Principles: for if the two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be coordinate with the King, and have power ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in themselves, not derived from him, they can not be comprehended under his politique ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Whereas he sayth the King can not make a law, and inferre from thence that the King alone without taking in the two houses hath not intire and plenary jurisdiction, his inference is very infirme; for it doth not diminish Majesty, but redounds to the glory of it,<note place="margin">Argum. l. 8. c. de legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> to give lawes to the people by the counsell and assent of wisemen: It hath been, and is for the most part the practice in absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, to make lawes that shall binde posterity by generall consent and agreement, which yet doth not deprive the Monarch of his power, or derogate any way from the plenitud and intirenesse thereof. But I shall speake more of this when I come to ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer their objections. Whereas he sayth that by a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politique compact of all sortes and degrees, not the Parliament, but the kingdome at large is properly meant, I know not why he should adde this, except it

                  </label> the Queene is there positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the onely supreame governour of the Realme, the wordes of a Statute, whatsoever the end was, are the law, and are pleadable in their usuall and grammatcall sence to all purposes. But was the oath framed onely to exclude a forraine power, are they sure of that? When God shall make inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for blood, and call the reverent Divines, the fuller Answerer, the Treatiser, and the rest of their Complices, to account for all the murders, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and injustice, whereof they have been the authours and abettors by stirring up the people to rebellion, and teaching them lies, they will be found to have broken the oath of alleagiance, now his Majesties rights have beene invaded by the two
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50355:19"/> houses, as well as if they had beene invaded by a forraigner: For the Statute was made as well to declare who was the supreame governour of the Realme, as to declare who was not; The Pope chalenged no superiority over the Queene in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, and yet in the oath the Queene is acknowledged the supreame governour of the Realme as well in Temporall as in Ecclesiasticall causes: This had been very superfluous, and a kinde of <hi>Excrescence</hi> in the oath if it had beene composed and given onely to exclude the Pope; and I wonder the Reverent Divines and the rest attributing so much to other Parliaments should attribute so little to that as to imagine them not able to frame a Statute in wordes and tearmes sutable to their ends and intentions; for surely their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much straitned if they could not declare the Popes authority to be voyd otherwise then by calling the Queene the onely supreame governour of the Realme, which was neyther true nor a fitte expression, if the two houses had beene coordinate with hir: neyther had they sufficiently excluded a forraine power by this Act, which, they say, was the onely end was aymed at: for the Pope claimed supreame jurisdiction over all in Ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as well over the two houses as over the Queene, yet in this Act provision is made for none but the Queene; by the title of the Statute all ancient juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are restored to the crowne, but there is no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50355:20"/> restauration of dignity or jurisdiction to the people or to their substitutes in Parliament, so that the Pope hath yet an interest in the Kingdome, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing enacted in this statute, if their <label type="milestone">

Lambart in his discourse upon the high courtes of justice almost at the end of his booke speaks punctually to this exception, <hi>Thus have I</hi> sayth he <hi>run along our courtes of all kindes, and have sayd (as I was able) severally of these lay and mixed courts of record, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from the crowne their originall, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one and one (as it were so many roses) from the garland of the Prince; leaving neverthelesse the garland it selfe undespoyled of that hir soveraigne vertue in the administration of justice: or as Bracton

               <p>In the first yeare of Edward the sixt an Act was made wherein the King is acknowledged to be the supreame head of the Church and Realme, and that all power and authority was derived from him. <hi>whereas the Archbishops and Bishops and other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall persons in this Realme do use to make and send out their summons,</hi>

Seeing that all authority of jurisdiction Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Temporall is derived and deducted from the Kings Majesty as supreame head of these Churches and Realmes of England and Irland, and so justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the cleargy of the sayd Realmes, and that all courtes Ecclesiasticall within the sayd two Realmes be kept by no other power or authority eyther forraine or within the Realme but by the authority of his most excellent Majesty. Be it therefore further enacted, &amp;c.</hi> Is it not evident from hence that the two houses of Parliament are subordinate to the King and that they have their power by derivation from him, who is the fountaine of all authority? These words <hi>seeing that all authority of jurisdiction Spirituall and Temporall is derived and deducted from the Kings Majesty, as supreame head of these Churches and Realmes of England and Irland,</hi> doe clearely intimate the two houses to have no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity radically in themselves, and to be no way coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate with the Kings Majesty in the rights of sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie.</p>
               <p>For conclusion of this Chapter I will adde one Act more made in the first yeare of King Iames, vvherein the tvvo houses of Parliament collectively taken made an humble recognition of their faith and obedience to him. <hi>We your most humble and loyall subjects the Lordes Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, doe from the bottome of our heartes yeald to the

And thereunto we most humbly and faithfully doe submit and oblige our selves, our heires, and posterities, for ever, untill the last drop of our bloods be spent: And do beseech your Majesty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the same as the first fruictes of this high court of Parliament, of our loyalty and fayth to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and your Royall progeny and posterity for ever.</hi> This is a farre different straine from that which the present pretended Parliament have used to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, who although bound both by oath and duty to have beene as respectfull and obedient towards him, yet have they themselves after many insolences committed against his person most audaciously and unadvisedly taken away his life, and procured others by diffamatory libells to blast his credit, who according to the trust reposed in them, cease not to traduce him, and by malicious aspersions to staine his chiefest vertues, creeping like snailes over the sweetest flowers, and leaving behind them their slime and filthinesse.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Kings supreamacy in particular shewed by the Statutes of the Land.</head>
               <p>THe Kings supreamacy in generall being thus confirmed by severall Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I vvill novv decende into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and shevv his Majesty to be legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested vvith all the particular rights of soveraigntie. I vvill beginne vvith the militia, vvhich is a right so essentiall to Majesty, that it can not nor ought not to be seperated from it: For Majesty consist not in a bare and empty title, but in the rights of soveraigntie, vvhich he can not be sayd to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, vvho vvants the svvorde to protect the septer. It vvas confessed by the two houses at the beginning of these dissentions, that the militia by right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined to his Majesty, and therefore at the first they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50355:23"/> laboured to have it assigned to them by his owne assent; but he opposing their unjust desires, as knowing both his owne and the ruin of his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would be the necessary consequences of such a grant, they resolved, seing they could not gaine it by surrender, to take it by assault, and assisted by men of like natures and incinations, they seised upon his Majesties forts and Magazins, and have since exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an arbitrary and tyrannicall power over the lives and estates of all that pleased them not, and none could ever please them, but such as are of the same humour and disposition vvith themselves. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards the pretended house of Commons thought it fit to take upon them the tuition of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to exercise the povver of the militia vvithout the Lordes; vvho though excluded from the society of government, vvill not be excluded from the society of their crimes, but are yet many of them ready to contribute to the effusion of more bloode, vvhich by men of that faction hath of late beene accounted a very cheape commodity, and upon all occasions spilt and povvred out like vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I must confesse I am amazed vvhen I consider hovv confidently and desperatly they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on their dissignes in a case so contrary to lavv and justice; for they could not have begun a vvarre or contested vvith his Majesty about a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more cleare then that of the militia, vvhich is a right so inherent in the crovvne, setled upon it by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50355:23"/> the fundamentall lawes of the lande, and confirmed by so many severall actes of Parliament, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the pretended Parliamentarians have a great dexterity in coyning distinctions to elude the lawes, yet they will not easily coyne such as shall serve their turne in this particular. In the seventh yeare of Edward the first a statute was made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne all men to go to Parliaments, Treatises, and generall Assemblies without force and armes, wherin the Kings power over the militia is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. <hi>The King to the justices of his bench sendeth greeting. Whereas of late before certaine persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to treat upon sundry debates had between us and certaine great men of our Realme, amongst other things it was accorded, that in our next Parliament after provision shall be made by us and the common assent of the Prelates, Earles, and Barons, that in all Parliaments, Treaties, and other Assemblies, which should be made in the Realme of England for ever, that every man shall come without all force and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour well and peaceably to the honour of us, and the peace of us and our Realme. And now in our next Parliament at Westminster after the sayd Treatise, the Prelates, Earles, Barons, and the Commonalty of our Realme their assembled to take advice of this businesse, have sayd, that to us it belongeth, and our parte is through our Royall seigniorie, straitly to defend force of armour, and all other force against our peace at all times when it shall please us, and to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50355:24"/> punish them which shall doe contrary, according to our lawes and usages of our Realme, and hereunto they are bounde to ayde us as their Soveraigne Lord at all seasons when need shall be. We command ye that ye cause these thinges to be read afore you in the said bench, and there to be inrolled. Given at Westminster the thirtieth day of october.</hi> In another Statute made the eleventh yeare of Henry the seventh, it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that all the subjects of the Realme but especially those that have by the King any dignities, giftes, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fees, or annuities; are bounde to assist the King in his warres against all rebellions, insurrections, and powers raysed against him. <hi>Where every sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by the duty of his allegeance is bounden to serve and assist his Prince and Soveraigne Lord at all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons when need shall require,</hi>

               <p>Secondly the legislative povver is an other right of soveraigntie, vvhereby Kings and supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are inabled by just and necessary lavves to provide for the peace and safty of their people, and this is vvholely and intirely in the King, although he be limited in the exercise of his povver so as he can not make lawes without the assent of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament. And this is that vvhich the pretended houses have stoode so much upon: because the Kings of England desiring to rule their people by lenity, have out of princely clemency condiscended so farre as not to impose upon them (vvhich they anciently did as I shall shevv hereafter) any nevv lavv, or alter and repeale the old, vvithout their ovvne consent, they from the premisses would make the people beleeve that their authority is equall to the Kings, and that themselves as their deputies are coordinate vvith him: and not

E. 3.</note> Now that the King hath a negative voyce in making lawes and that nothing can or ought to be esteemed an Act of Parliament without him, is evident by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Statutes. In the first year of King James a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was made wherin the two houses petitioning the King, that the recognition of their duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as also of his Majesties right unto the crowne of England, might be published in high court of Parliament, to remaine as a memoriall to all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50355:28"/> taken by all the Kings subjects for the surety of the succession of the crowne of England, the oath was this; <hi>Ye shall sweare to beare faith, truth,</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50355:29"/> this oath, first, that they sweare <hi>inclusivè</hi> to beare all faith, truth and obedience, to the Kings Majesty and his heires, and onely to them; Secondly that they sweare <hi>exclusivè</hi> to beare faith, truth, and obedience, to no other eyther within the realme or without, not to other <hi>persons,</hi> nor to other <hi>authority,</hi> by both which clauses of the oath it appears, that the King, and none but the King, can challenge faith and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance from the people.<note place="margin">28. H. 8. cap. 7.</note> Afterwards in the eight and twenty yeare of King Henry the eight the like oath was injoyned to be taken by all his subjects touching his succession by Queen Iane, for the former Act touching his succession by Queene Anne was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, but the oath injoyned was otherwise the same; And in the five and thirty year of his reigne an other oath was framed, wherein, besids the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the former touching allegiance due to the King and his heires, some other additions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted touching his supreamacy in Ecclesiasticall causes: because the former oaths were not thought full enough to that effect and purpose; And these oathes were extraordinary and imposed by speciall appointment: But besyds these there is an other ordinary oath of Allegiance which was first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by King Arthur,<note place="margin">l. 35.</note> and is mentioned amongst the lawes of King Edward, and confirmed by the lawes of William the Conquerour;<note place="margin">l 59.</note> this oath continueth still in force and should by the law be given in every Leete.

I could yet adde divers other acts of Parliament to confirme this and all the other particulars above named, but I suppose these which are allready alledged, are more then sufficient, there are also other rightes of sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie which I could shew by the statutes to be in the King, but because there is no contestation about them I will not fight with a shadow; those above mentioned are the chiefest and inseperable from Majesty.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Kings supreamacy in generall shewed by the Common law.</head>
               <p>HAving shewed the Kings supreamacy from the Statutes, I come now to the Common law, which is the grounde and foundation of it; for Statutes are but declarations of the royall power, the power it selfe with the severall modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and qualifications of it is more ancient then any statute, and can not be limited or restrained by an Acte of Parliament in any thing that tends to the derogation or diminution of Majesty: for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Monarchy by the Common law is an absolute Monarchy susceptible of no alteration in the rightes and preheminences of Majesty.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50355:32"/>
               <p>First I say the English Monarchy is an absolute Monarchy by the Common law admitting no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the rightes of soveraigntie, the King alone being the onely supreame head and governour having none superiour to him or coordinate with him eyther singly or collectively taken. this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly determined in Sir Edward cokes reportes who hath beene cryed up by the pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians for the oracle of the law, as being no wayes guilty of too much affection to prerogative: the wordes of the reporte are these. <hi>If that Acte of the first yeare of the late Queene, had never been made it was resolved by all the judges that the King or Queene of England for the time being may make such an ecclesiasticall commission as is before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ancient prerogative and law of England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coke. lib. 5. in Caudreys case.</note>
                  <hi>And therefore by the ancient lawes of this realme this Kingdome of England is an absolute empire and Monarchy consisting of one heade which is the King and of a body politique compact and compounded of many and almost infinite severall and yet well agreeing members; all which the law divideth into two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall partes, that is to say the cleargy, and the laytie, both of them next and immediatly under God subject and obedient to the head; also the Kingely head of thise Politique body is instituted and furnished with plenarie and intire power, prerogative, and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to render justice and right to every part and member of thise body of what estate degree, or calling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50355:32"/> soever, in all causes Ecclesiasticall or temporall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he should not be a heade of the whole body.</hi> This is further proved by Sir Edward Coke by divers presidents and, Acts of Parliament, who concludeth his reporte after this manner.<note place="margin">Fol. 40. 6.</note>
                  <hi>Thus hath it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as well by the ancient common lawes of this realme, by the resolutions and judgements of the judges, and sages of the lawes of England in all succession of ages, as by authority of many acts of Parliament ancient and of later times, that the Kingdome of England is an absolute Monarchy, and that the King is the onely supreame governour as well-over Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and in Ecclesiasticall causes as temporall within this realme; to the due observation of which lawes both the King and the subject are sworne.</hi> Bracton sayth as much in effect, although he calleth not the English Monarchy an absolute Monarchy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse tearmes. <hi>Sicut Dominus Papa in Spiritualibus super omnibus habeat ordinariam jurisdictionem, ita habet Rex in Regno suo ordinariam in Temporalibus, &amp; pares non habet neque superiores.</hi> As the Pope hath ordinary jurisdiction over all in Spirituall causes, so hath the King in his Kingdome in Temporall,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 15.</note> and he hath none coordinate with him, or superiour to him. Bracton speaketh not here of particular men, but of the people collectively taken; he sayth the King is over all, and he compareth his temporall jurisdiction with the Spirituall jurisdiction of the Pope, which in his time was acknowledged in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50355:33"/> to extende <hi>ad universos,</hi> as well as <hi>ad singulos,</hi> as it is now in all other places where it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
               <p>In the second yeare of King Iames in Hillary tearme letters being directed to the judges to have their resolution concerning the validity of a grant made by Queene Elizabeth under the great seale, of the benefit of a penall Statute; in which grant power was given to the Lord Chancellor or keeper of the great seale, to make dispensations when and to whome he pleased, after great deliberation it was resolved, that when a Statute is made by Acte of Parliament for the publique good, the King could not give the power of dispensation to any subject, or grant the forfeitures upon penall lawes to any before the same be recovered and vested in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by due and lawfull proceedings: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son their alledged is because the King as head of the commonwealth, and the fountaine of justice and mercy, ought to have these rightes of soveraigntie annexed onely to his Royall person. <hi>Car quant un statute est fait pro bono publico &amp; le Roy (come le teste del bien publique &amp; le fountaine de justice &amp; mercie) est par tout le realme trust ove ceo cest confidence &amp; trust est cy inseparablement adjoyne &amp; annexe al Royall person del Roy in cy haut point de soveraigntie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coke lib. 7. tit. penall. Statutes.</note>
                  <hi>que il ne poit transferre ceo al disposition on poiar d'ascune privat person ou al ascune privat use.</hi> For when a statute is made for the publique good and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50355:33"/> the King (as head of the commonwealth and the fountaine of justice and mercy) is by all the Realme trusted vvith it, that confidence and trust is so inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably annexed to the Royall person of the King in so high a point of Soveraigntie that he can not transferre it to the disposition or povver of a private person or to any private use. I shal not need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and amplify the matter by arguments and inferences dravvne from these reportes for the vvordes are cleare of themselves, and do expresly declare and resolve the Monarchy of England to be an absolute Monarchy, the King alone to be the only supreame head and governour of the vvhole body, that is of all the people, as vvell collectively as severally taken.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, (namely in regard of the Kings supreamacy he being the onely head of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, having no equall or superiour but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, vvhose Vicegerent he is upon earth) that the common lavv doth by vvay of fiction and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude attribute unto him the Divine perfections.

               <p>If a man houldeth lande both of the King and other inferiour Lordes whereby his heire becometh a warde, the King alone shall have the custody both of the heire and land, the reason which is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in lawe is because the King can have none coordinate with him, or superiour to him. <hi>Glanvil. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Si quis in Capite de Domino Rege tenere debet, tunc ejus custodia ad Dominum Regem plene pertinet: sive alios Dominos habere debeat ipse haeres, sive non, quia Dominus Rex nullum habere potest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, multo minus superiorem.</hi> If any man houldeth lande of our Lord the King <hi>in capite,</hi> then his ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe shall wholly belonge to our Lord the King, whether he hath other Lordes or not, because the King can have no equall, much lesse a superiour.

               <p>By the common lawe there lyeth no action or write against the King,<note place="margin">21.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50355:36"/> is because the King is supreame and accountable to none but God. Bracton lib. 1. cap. 8. <hi>Non debet esse major eo,</hi> (I. e.

This is all the helpe which a subject hath against the King, because he is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, and bound to give an account af his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to none but God, and this is the course which the two houses of Parliament are to take by law in case the King infringeth or is supposed to infringe the rightes and liberties of the people, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by divers petitions of right exhibited in former Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Secondly I say, the English Monarchie by the common lawe is susceptible of no alteration in the rightes and preheminences of Majesty; I meane by any Act of Parliament, or by any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of King and people: what a conqueror in a just warre, or what the people may doe in case the bloode Royall, which God prohibite, should be extincte, is not now disputable: but so long as there remains a King, or heire apparent to the crowne, the rights and preheminences of Majesty can by no act, agreement, stipulation, or covenant

But if the Statute say, his licence shall be voyd, there the licence shall have a clause of <hi>non obstante,</hi> viz. it shall say any Statute to the contrarie notwithstanding. or otherwise it is not good: As the Statute 23.

That which I have hitherto sayd of the rightes and preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Majesty, is to be understood of those rightes and preheminences that are so essentiall to it, as they can not be separated vvithout the diminution or destruction of Majesty. As the power of the militia, the power of making lawes, the power of appointing Iudges, and such like Actes of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as also the power of dispensing with penall Statutes, the power of pardoning the transgressions
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50355:38"/> of the law, the power of prosecuting the law, and such like supreame actes of justice and mercy: some of which rightes and preheminences can not be taken away without giving a wounde, others not without bringing death, and dissolution to Majesty: yet there are other rightes and preheminences that are called priviledges, which are not so essentiall to Majesty, but that thy may by speciall grace of the King be seperated. <hi>Bracton. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Ea vero quae jurisdictionis sunt &amp; pacis &amp; ea quae sunt justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; paci annexa ad nullam pertinent nisi ad Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam &amp; dignitatem Regiam, nec à Corona seperari po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt cum faciant ipsam Coronam.

It may seeme strainge that the King and the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are virtually the whole kingdome, should not have power to make what lawes they please, and to binde themselves and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50355:39"/> by them in thinges not repugnant to the law of God; yet if we consider the grounde of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainte, we shall finde it reasonable: for they which lay the first foundation of a commonwealth, have authority to make lawes that can not be altered by posterity in matters that concerne the rightes both of King and people: for foundations can not be removed without the ruine and subversion of the whole buildinge: As for example, the division of thinges which is made at the first foundation of a commonvvealth (vvhether the people tooke the country they divide from the inhabitants by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest in a just vvarre, or vvhether they did first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually possesse it themselves as being before emptie and vacant) can not be altered by posterity, and a nevv division made vvithout manifest injustice. The lavves vvhich they then make for the preservation of their right and proprietie in the sayd division, can not be disanulled by succeding Parliaments, nor can any particular man be deprived of his inheritance, vvhich descend unto him by vertue of that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or of any parte or parcell, or appurtenances thereof, by any contrary lavv vvhich shall be made by them; I speake not vvhat Parliaments may do by force, but vvhat they may justly doe; for they have not such an arbitrary povver, but that they are alvvayes in a morrall subjection to the rules of justice and naturall equity. And in this case the Kinges condition ought not to be vvorse then the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50355:39"/> peoples, but his share and rightes in the said division are as firmely and unchangeably to be preserved, as the share and rightes of particular men: And both the King and people are obliged to this, not onely by the rules of justice, and naturall equity, but by oath, and by the municipall lawes of the lande, to which they are both sworne. That the King is bound to this, appeares by the lawes of King Edward.<note place="margin">l. 17.</note>

There are also souldiers under the King chosen to exercise the <hi>militia.</hi> And in the beginning of his booke he saith that it is necessary this povver should be in the King. <hi>In Rege qui recte regit, necessaria sunt duo haec, arma videlicet et Leges, quibus utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tempus bellorum et pacis recte possit gubernari: utrumque enim istorum alterius indiget auxilio, quo tam res militaris possit esse in tuto, quam ipsae Leges usu armorum et praesidio possint esse servatae. Si autem arma defecerint contra hostes, rebelles, et indomitos, sic erit regnum indefensum: Si autem Leges, sic exterminabitur justitia.</hi> In a King that governeth vvell, tvvo thinges are necessary, armes and lavves, by vvhich he may be enabled to rule both in times of peace and vvarre; and both these neede the helpe of on another, vvhereby both armes and lavves may be preserved. If armes be vvanting against enemies, and rebells, the Kingdome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50355:41"/> shall be without defence; if lawes be wanting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out justice. This is also evident from the Tenures, whereby most of the chiefe men in the kingdome hould their estates: for all that hould <hi>in capite</hi> by knightes service, are bound for their fee to assist the King in his warres whensoever they shall be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by him; whether it be to suppresse rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or to resist a forraine invasion. And this hath beene the knowne law of the land ever since the the time of William the Conqueror, in the fourth yeare of whose reigne this right vvas confirmed unto him by Acte of Parliament: The vvordes of the Statute are these. <hi>Statuimus et firmiter praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimus, ut omnes Comites, et Barones, et milites, et servientes, et universi liberi homines totius regni nostri praedicti habeant et teneant se semper bene in armis, et in equis ut decet et oportet, et quod sint semper prompti et parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis explendum et peragendum, cum semper opus adfuerit, secundum quod nobis debent de feodis, et tenementis suis de jure facere, et sicut illis statuimus per commune consilium totius Regni nostri praedicti, et illis dedimus et concessimus in feodis jure heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario.</hi> We vvill and command that all Earles, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Souldiers, villeins, and all free men of our vvhole kingdome, be alvvayes vvell provided vvith horse and armes, as it behoveth them, and that they be alvvayes in a readinesse to serve us as often as need shall require according as they are bound
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50355:42"/> by their landes and tenements, and as vve have appointed them to doe by the common councell of our vvhole kingdome, and <hi>for that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> have given and granted them landes in fee for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly the legislative povver belonge to the King alone by the Common Lavv, the tvvo houses have authority granted them by the King to assent or dissent, but the povver that maks it a lavv the authority that animats it and maks it differ from a dead letter, is in the King, who is the life and soule of the law by whose authority alone the lavves commande, and forbid, and vindicate, and punish offendors. So sayth Bracton lib. 1. cap. 2. <hi>Hujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi verò Leges Anglicanae, et consuetudines, Regum authoritate jubent quandoque, quandoque vetant, et quandoque vindicant et puniunt transgressores.</hi> These Lavves and customes of England by the Kinges au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doe sometimes command, sometimes forbid, and somtimes chastise and punish trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours. This vvas also resolved by divers Earles and Barons, and by all the justices in the time of Edvvard the third: For one <hi>Haedlow</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> having a controversy vvith the <hi>King,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to have it decided in Parliament, a reference being made to divers Earles, and Barons, and to all the justices, to consider of the businesse, it vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that the tvvo houses vvere not coordinate vvith the King in the Legislativer Povver, but that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50355:42"/> the King alone made lawes by the assent of the two houses, that he had none equall or coordinate with him in his realme, and that he could not be judged by the Parliament.<note place="margin">22. E. 3. 6.</note>
                  <hi>Fuit dit que le Roy fist les leis per assent des peres &amp; de la commune, et non pas les peres, et le commune: Et que il ne avera nul pere en sa terre demesne, et que le Roy per eux ne doit estr̄ ajuge.</hi> It was resolved that the King make lawes by the assent of the Lordes and Commons, and not the Lordes and Commons: and that he could have no peere in his owne land, and that he could not be judged by them. The Common practice of the lawe confirme this as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Iudges; for the breach of any Statute whether it be by treason, murther, felony, perjury, or by any other way, is an offence against the Kinges authority alone, and pleas made against such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are called the pleas of the crowne, because they are done <hi>encounter la corone et dignitie le Roy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stanford les plees del corone. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> against the crowne and dignity of the King. So that it is not the dignity and authority of the Lordes and Commons which is violated by contempt of the law, but the dignitie and authority of the King. He may dispence also with such lawes as forbid a thinge which is not <hi>malum in se,</hi> and pardon the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others, as Treason, Felonie, and the like; which in reason he ought no more to doe, then to dispence with the lawes of <hi>Germany,</hi> or pardon the transgressours thereof, if they were not made by

Againe the King calling the Iudges to him, hath a power to interprete the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and it is an uncontroulable Maxime of Law, <hi>Ejusdem est leges interpretari cujus est condere:</hi> None can interpret the lavves, but the same povver that make them. I knovv the tvvo houses have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged this povver, and voted it a high breach of priviledge for any to question their authority herein: but vve desire they vvould shew us by vvhat lavv they can vvorke such miracles; for the King taking the Iudges to him, have alvvayes had that povver by the lavves of the land: their exposition upon the Statute of Glocester made in the sixt yeare of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard the first is extant amongst the printed Statutes, and followeth immediatly after the sayd Statute, in these vvordes. <hi>After by the King and his Iustices, certaine expositions were made upon some of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles above mentioned, that is to wit, to the first article, for entries by disseisin, damages shall run from the time of the Statute published. In the same wise, in writs of</hi> entre <hi>upon disseisin and in all writs of</hi> Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauncester. Cousenage, Aiel <hi>or</hi> Besaiel, <hi>of intrusion by ones owne acte by any manner of write, damages shall run after the write purchased against them that held by Statute, albeit their ancestors died seised thereof. Touching an Inquest to be made of such as be with in age, the Statute shall run without limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time. Touching alienation of landes houlden by the lawe of England, the Statute shall run for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50355:43"/> such landes being aliened after the time of the Statute published. In like manner the Statute shall extend and run upon the landes of a wife aliened by hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (whereas no fine was levied thereof in court.) Touching landes being let in fee ferme, to pay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yearly the fourth parte of the very value thereof, the Statute shall run as well unto landes that were leased before the making of the Statute, as after, in case that the tenant have withhoulden above the space of two yeares after the Statute published, so much as he should have paid to his leassor yearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of the Covenant. And as to the punishment of wast in all cases (except it be of dowers and wards) it shall be understanded of wasts done sithens the Statute published. And of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of treble in cases of wast of dowers, and wardships, it shall be understanded of wasts commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the Statute published. And as concerning them which doe alien their dowers, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed after the publishing of the Statute. Given at Glocester the Sunday next after the feast of Saint</hi> Peter ad vincula, <hi>the sixt yeare of the reigne of King Edward the first;</hi> Here we see to whome the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the law belongeth, the Iudges by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have a power to interpret it <hi>judicialiter,</hi> they could not otherwise proceede to judgement; but being, called by the King, with him, and under him, they have a power to interpret it <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi> as hath been the practice, and is the knowne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50355:44"/> law of the Lande. But for the two houses (besids that they can doe nothing jointly together, unlesse the King doth actually concurre with them) their structure is such that they are altogether uncapable and unfit to interpret law: For the power that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete law must be alwayes existent, to act as new occasions shall arise, which require the exercise of that power, which the two houses are not. And yet were they alwayes existent, both houses having a negative voyce, upon any disagreement between them, the interpretation of the law must be retarded, and all controversies depending there upon unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided: and this disagreement might perhaps en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, and so a finall determination in such suites would be impossible, except they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their differences by force, which they have beene often necessitated to doe, since they have usurped the power of interpreting law, and ordering the affaires of the Kingdome. Now these are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which ought not to be admitted in any commonwealth: for it derogats both from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wisdome of a Nation to be so moulded and framed, that justice can not have a free passage in all contingencies. I will yet adde for the further clearing of this pointe, that not onely the legislative power it selfe, but the very exercise of the power also, so farre as it is essentiall to government is in the King alone; for he can by edicts and proclamations provide for all necessary occasions, and speciall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50355:44"/> emergencies, not provided for by fixed and certaine lavvs; vvhich is one of the most excellent and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent actes of the legislative povver, and a sufficient remedy against all mischiefes, in case the tvvo hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should refuse to concurre vvith him in those thinges vvhich concerne the benefit of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He may also grant immunities, liberties, and priviledges, to any colledge, tovvne, cittie, or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and authorise the sayd communities to make such locall statutes as shall oblige every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof so farre as they contradict not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Statutes of the Land, vvhich are all actes of the legislative povver that he can exercise vvithout the concurrence of the tvvo houses. Novv concerning the Kinges negative voice, it is the knovvne lavv of the land that the King hath a povver of dissenting, and that no act of Parliament can have any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity except eyther in person or under his seale he signifies his assent.<note place="margin">12.

               <p>Thirdly allegeance or ligeancy is due to the King, and none but the King by the common lavv, as Sir
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50355:45"/> Edvvard Coke shevveth at large in Calvins case from the resolution of the judges. <hi>By that which hath been sayd appeareth,</hi> sayth he, <hi>that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is due onely to the King so as therein the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not now</hi> cui sed quomodo debetur. <hi>It is true that the King hath two capacities in him, one a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body being discended of the blood Royall of the realme, and this body is of the creation of almighty God, and is subject to death, infirmity, and such like; The other is a politique body or capacity, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led because it is framed by the policy of man (and in the</hi> 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 39. <hi>B. is called a misticall body) and in this capacity the King is esteemed to be immortall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, not subject to death, infirmity, infancy, nonage, &amp;c.

For no man will affirme that England it selfe taking it for the continent thereof, doth owe any ligiance or faith, or that any faith or ligeance should be due to it; but it manifestly appeareth, that the ligeance or faith of the subject is</hi> proprium quarto modo <hi>to the King,</hi> omni, soli, &amp; semper.</p>
               <p>Fourtly, the power of making Iudges, and all such State officers, as exercise any jurisdiction, is in the King alone by the Common law, and can not, nor ought not to be seperated from him: for it is not reasonable that deligate Iudges should be substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by any but those whose deligates they are; nor can a King execute justice according to his oath (which next the Glory of God is the chiefe ende of Government) by a naked title onely; His subjects may be vexed by the rapine and exactions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Iudges, they may be wearied by delayes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by insupportable fees, opprest many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall wayes, and the King in the meane time must stand still and looke on, being too weake to resist, if his handes be bound, and he disabled from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing their delinquencies, and deputing others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their places. And therefore this power can not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50355:46"/> be disunited from the crowne, but ought to be <hi>de jure,</hi> as it hath alwayes beene <hi>de facto,</hi> a part of the Kings prerogative. <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. de actioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Et si ipse Dominus Rex ad singulas causas terminandas non sufficiat, ut levior sit illi labor in plures personas partito onere, eligere debet de regno suo viros sapientes &amp; timentes Deum, in quibus sit veritas eloquiorum, &amp; qui oderunt avaritiam (quae inducit cupiditatem) &amp; ex illis constituere Iusticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios, Vicecomites, &amp; alios Ballivos, &amp; Ministros suos, quibus referantur tam quaestiones super dubijs, quam querimoniae super injurijs.</hi> And if our Lord the King be not sufficient to determine all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies him selfe, he ought to selecte wise men, fearing God, and hating covetousnesse, and out of them constitute Iustices, Sherifts, Bailies, and other officers, to whome controversies and complaintes may be referred. The practice of the law hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beene the same since Bractons time, and all Iudges and chief officers appointed by write, patent, or commission from the King. Hence it is that all patents and commissions of Iudges, and other such officers, determineth by the common law at the Kings death. <hi>Coke tit. discontinuance de proces, &amp;c. part.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>Al common ley per demise le Roy le plea fuit discontinue, &amp; le proces que fuit agard, &amp; nient returne devant le mort, le Roy fuit perde: Car per le breve del predecessor rien poit estre execute in le temps del novel Roy, si non que il soit in especiall

               <head type="sub">The Kings supreamacy both in generall and particular shewed by reasons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the lawes and customes of the Land.</head>
               <p>ALthough I esteeme positive lawes and customes more demonstrative then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and inferences, yet these have also their weight and importance; I will therefore in the last place adde such reasons as shall suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirme the Kings supreamacy, although the lawes had positively declared, or the Iudges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved nothing concerning it.</p>
               <p>First, that power which is so under controule
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50355:49"/> that it can be annihilated at the will of an other, must needs be inferiour to that power which doe so overrule and master it; Now such is the condition of Parliaments, that the King by lavv can annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them at his pleasure; for they depend upon him <hi>quoad existentiam</hi> for their existence and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: If it should be granted that Parliaments are <hi>in actu signato</hi> by originall constitution, yet the precise time of their existence, and continuance, hath alwayes been at the Kings appointment, it being in his power to call them and dissolve them vvhen he please. So that they must needs be subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to him and depend upon him for their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when they depende upon him for their exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence. To this the <hi>reverent Divines,</hi> answer, that for the convention of Parliaments, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
                  </label> the State have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in some cases to meete together in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a legall warrant from the King, as if the King be a prisoner in the enemies handes, or distracted; and have done it <hi>de facto</hi> in the infancy and minority of some Kinges: and for the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Parliaments, they say that they have heard <hi>wise men</hi> affirme, that by lawe a Parliament can not be dissolved whilst there are any petitions of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or such matters of importance depending and unfinished. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> What needed the <hi>reverent Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to have cited these <hi>wise men?</hi> Could they not as easily have sayd themselves that Parliaments could not be dissolved by the Kinges command, as they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50355:49"/> sayd they might be called without it? Perhaps they thought that such notorious falsities would never passe currantly amongst the people, if they were not confirmed by the authority of <hi>wise men</hi> as well as by their owne: yet I beleeve the <hi>wise men</hi> they speake of were not so <hi>wise</hi> as <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they were, their magisteriall dictats must not passe for law; for both that which these <hi>wise men</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and that vvhich they affirme <hi>themselves,</hi> is manifestly opposit to lavve and truth. There vvas never yet since the first foundation of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie a Parliament called vvithout a legall vvarrant from the King, nor can a Parliament be called vvithout it; for the cases put by them are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impertinent, and can not be supposed: the King according to his politique capacity can not be a prisoner, or an infant, or distracted; but in case his condition be such as make him uncapable to guide and mannage his charge in person, as in case of infancy, or distraction, the law hath made suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient provision who shall exercise the regall power in such occurrencies; if he be a prisoner in the enemies handes he may substitute others, or if he be so closely kept as that can non be permitted, in such events also the law is not deficient: but in all these cases nothing can be acted by authority inherent in the people, but by the Kings authority, which can never be in prison, nor is it subject to infancy or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction; and Parliaments called at such time, by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50355:50"/> those that have authority by law to exercise the Royall power, are called by a legall warrant from the King; and without such a legall warrant they never were nor can be called: If there have been any generall Conventions without it, as the <hi>reverent Divines</hi> (who should have done well to have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their authours, and their wordes) assure us, their actes were never esteemed lawes, nor such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Parliaments. And that the King hath a power by law of dissolving Parliaments when he shall thinke it fit, hath been alwayes without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy: The two houses in the last Parliament, though thrifty managers of their priviledges, never claimed an arbitrary povver of sitting vvithout the Kings assent:<note place="margin">Modus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum 4. pars instit. fol 3. 4.</note> It is a knowne <hi>Maxime</hi> of the lawe, <hi>Rex est Principium, Caput, &amp; Finis Parliamenti.</hi> The King is the Beginning, the Head, and the Ende of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that last fashioned and reformed the English Monarchie obteined the crowne by conquest; he had it not by election as a gifte and gratuity of the people, but made his passage by the Svvord: and Conquerours are not wont to allow <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>1</label> of such coordinations, or admit so many sharers in the rightes of Soveraigntie as it phantasied. Some answere that conquest is no good title; But I shall speake of this at large in the second question, where I shall shew that conquest in a just warre under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by those that have authority, is a lawfull and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50355:50"/> just title. Others answer that the conquest was not <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>2</label> full and intire, but a partiall conquest, occasioning a composition and agreement, and so the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is specificated according to that finall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and agreement, which was made. I deny not a composition and agreement, but I say there was none such as is pretended: for the composition and agreement was made after a victory; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> and it is not probable that the conquerour having beene at such expence of bloode in gaining the crovvne and rightes of Soveraigntie, should after his victorie give them avvay againe, and agree to such a mixture as is pleaded for. And although it may be justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from them to prove that there vvas such a composition and agreement, as they speake of made betvveene them; yet I vvill take the burden of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon my selfe, and shevv there vvas not: for all the composition and agreement vvhich vvas made or reported to be made by any author, vvas a grant from the conquerour that the Kingdome should injoy the ancient lavves and customes, vvhereby it had been formerly governed, vvhich vvere called the lavves of King <hi>Edward:</hi> this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, being moved by the petitions and instances of the people, in the fourth yeare of his reigne, vvherin he confirmed unto them the sayd lavves and customes. Novv amongst the lavves of King <hi>Edward</hi> there is nothing to be founde that can give the least colour or pretence for such a coordination
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50355:51"/> as is conceited, but on the other side the Kinges su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is chiefly established by the ancient lavves of the land, for the common lavv vvas the same it is novv before the conquest; And is the base and pillar of Royall povver, as hath already been shevved sufficiently: To vvhich I could adde many other things out of the lavves of King <hi>Edward</hi> vvherin the King is declared to be a Monarch and to be Gods vicegerent constituted and ordained to governe the Kingdome (vvhich include the people collectively taken) and his Church, and to protect and defend them (which is an act belonging onely to supreame authority,<note place="margin">

A King is obliged in time of Parliament to follow the advice and direction of the two houses, and out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his privie counsell, when their advice and direction tendeth to the preservation of his person, and of his Royall authority, and to the preservation of his people, and of their rights and priviledges; not that counsellors have authority over Kings, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the matter of their counsells do morally oblige their consciences: but if their advice and direction tend to the ruin of eyther, he may and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50355:54"/> from their counsells; and such a King is not a tyrant, but such counsellours traitors by the law. This is mysteriously represented to the Lords when they are first preferred to that degree and dignity, by the usuall solemnities then performed; for if in stead of giving counsell for the King, they give counsell against him, they are not onely by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Land declared to be traitors, but if the Statutes were silent, by a tacite condition of law an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their dignities, and vayled under certaine cerimonies used at their first creation, they are to be condemned for such, and to forfeit their estates. Coke in Nevils case lib. 7. fol. 34. <hi>Ceux que sont countees ount office de graund trust &amp; confidence, &amp; sont create pur</hi> 2. <hi>purposes:</hi> 1. ad consulendum regi tempore pacis: 2. ad defendendum regem &amp; patriam tempore belli. <hi>Et pur c̄ antiquitie ad done eux</hi> 2. <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes a resembler ceux deux duties: car primerem̄t lour teste est adorn ove un cappe de honor, &amp; coronet, &amp; lour corps ove un robe in resemblance de counsel: secundm̄t ilz sont succinct ove un espee in resemblans q̄ ilz ser̄r Foiall et loyal a defender lour Prince et pays: Donques quant tiel person encoūt le dutie et fine de son dignitie, prist non solem̄t counsell, mes armes auxi encoūt le Roy a luy destroyer et de c̄ est attaint per due course del ley, per ceo il ad forfeit son dignitie per un condition tacite annexe al estate de dignitie.</hi> They which are Earles have an office of great trust and confidence and are created for two purposes first, to

He hath thereby forfeited his dignitie by a tacite condition annexed unto it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the Parliament is one of the Kinges courts as is apparent both by our Statutes and law bookes;<note place="margin">1. Iac. cap 1. Bracton lib. 2. cap. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50355:56"/> themselves to govern by, so farre as concerns their owne jurisdiction, and the administration of that power which they have in the supposed coordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not therfore because they are his subjects, or because they are summoned in his name by his writ, or yet because they are called to be his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and to assist him to make lawes to govern by, that makes it his court, but because it derives autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from him; It is authority that constituts a court, and inables it to proceed judicially, he which owns that, is owner and Master of the Court. Whereas he saith that the <hi>Parliament is not his as his other courts are, altogether deriving there whole authority from the fulnesse which is in him,</hi> he contradicts all that he sayd before; for if the two houses derive not their authority from his Majesty, but have it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically in themselves, how is there a fulnesse of power in him? if the <hi>jura Majestatis</hi> be divided amongst them, he hath not a fulnesse, but his share onely of power: or how do they assist him to make lawes to govern by? they assist not him alone, but all the three estates are mutually assistant to one another in making lawes to govern jointly, where their joint concurrence is necessary, or to govern in their severall charges, where they may act severally. Or lastly how can they be called his subjects? sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is due to the three estates acting together, or to eyther of them in their severall places, and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, as well as to him; for it is due to him
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50355:56"/> in the administration of that power which belong to him alone, so is it likewise to them in things within the verge and compasse of their authority. And as this last part of his answer is a contradiction to the former, so is it likewise to the lawes of the land; for I have sheved as well by the Statutes as Common lavv, that all authority both Ecclesiasticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is derived from the Kings Majesty; and that he hath full and plenary povver to attaine and reach to all the ends of Government: M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.<note place="margin">Archeion fol. 274.</note>

               <p>I <hi>Ecgfride</hi> by the grace of God King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> in the year of our Lord seven hundred ninety sixe, in the fourth Indiction, and first yeare of our reigne, do give and grant, for my ovvne soule, and the soules of my ancestours vvith the assent and testimony of my Nobles, ten Hydes of land called <hi>Tyrefeld</hi> vvith the Boundes thereof, unto the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of <hi>Saint Albane:</hi> and I exempt the sayd landes from all services, and make them free vvith the same freedome vvhich vvas granted to the rest of the

               <p>This <hi>Charter</hi> vvas vvritten at <hi>Chelchyd</hi> in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike Synod.</p>
               <p>By this Charter it is evident, that Parliaments vvere houlden in those times without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for whereas it is specified by the King, that the above said landes were given <hi>cum consensu &amp; testimonio Optimatum,</hi> his meaning is, that his grant was confirmed by the assent and testimony of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and yet the word <hi>Optimates</hi> can not be extended to the Commons, neyther vvas his grant confirmed by their testimony.

                  <hi>Edwin</hi> King of Northumberland, the second of a Parliament houlden by <hi>Segebert</hi> King of the East Saxons, whereunto they called their friends and their wise men;<note place="margin">Beda Hist. Eccles. lib. 2. cap. 13.</note> for <hi>Edwine</hi> being insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Paulinus to imbrace the Christian religion, answered {that} <hi>he ƿolde mid his freondum</hi> &amp; <hi>mid his þitum sƿraece</hi> &amp; <hi>geþeate habban,</hi> that he would speake with his friends and with his wise men in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which he did accordingly, and by their assent, himselfe his whole Nobility, and a great part of the commons, were baptised, in like manner Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert held a Parliament whereunto he called his friendes and his wise men upon the like occasion,<note place="margin">Beda Eccles. Hist. lib. 3. cap. 22.</note>
                  <hi>Ða haef ðe geþeate mid his pitum</hi> &amp; <hi>freondum</hi> &amp; <hi>mid heora trymenysse</hi> &amp; <hi>fultum</hi> &amp; <hi>geþafunge cristes geleafan onfeng.</hi> Then he held a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his wise men and friendes, and by their advice, aide, and consent, received the Christian faith. From this I gather that their wise men could not be their Nobility and commons, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Lambart supposeth, for all their friends must needs be contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under one of those degrees, and in case his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position were true, should not have been distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from their wise men, which in all good construction they must, for the wordes do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently imply, that besides their vvise men, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led such other of their friendes, as they thought, by reason of their prudence, or povver and prevalency
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50355:60"/> vvith the people, vvere most like to assist them, and further their designes. But whosoever their wise men were, although they vvere frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet they vvere not all of them called al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes to make lavves, for in the time of Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane divers lavves vvere made by the counsell and assent of the cleargie alone, vvhich vve find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his other lavves. <hi>Ic Aeþelstane Cyning Eallum minum gerefum binnon mine rice gecyþe mid geþeate þulfhel-mes mines Aercebiseoþes</hi> &amp; <hi>calra mina oþra biseopa</hi> &amp; <hi>godes ðeoþa for mina sinna forgyfnesse</hi> {that} <hi>ic þille, &amp;c.</hi> I <hi>Ethelstane</hi> King signify to all my governours vvithin my Kingdome, that by the advise of <hi>Wulfhelmus</hi> my Archbishope, and all my other Bishops, and servants of God, for the forgivenesse of my sinnes, I have ordained, &amp;c. The lavves that goe before these vvere made by the assent of the Archbishope <hi>Wulfhelmus</hi> and other Bishops onely, and they vvhich follovv after at a more generall convention at <hi>Gratlie</hi> vvhere the Archbishop <hi>Wulfhelmus</hi> and many Noble men, and vvise men vvere present. And although lavves vvere frequently made and Parliaments houlden, in the reignes of the <hi>Saxon Kinges,</hi> yet the people had been so seldome called to such conventions in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first,<note place="margin">Polydor. Virgil. lib. 11. Hist.</note> that <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> saith that institution may seeme to have sprung from him. <hi>At illud appositè habeo dicere, Reges ante haec tempora non
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50355:60"/> consuevisse populi conventum consultandi causa (nisi perraro) facere, adeo ut ab</hi> Henrico <hi>id institutum jure manasse dici possit.</hi> But this I can speake appositely, that Kings before these times vvere not accustomed (except very seldome) to call the people to their consultations, so that this institution may be said to have had its first beginning from King <hi>Henry.</hi> This is certaine the house of Commons hath been accustomed novv a long time to give their consent in making lavves, but hovv long is not certaine; their opinion is most likely which think this custome began to take place about the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first. For there are probable reasons which confirme, that lawes were made without the concurrence of the Commons long after the time of the above said <hi>Henry</hi> the first, who, although he did call them more frequently then any of his predecessours had done, yet did not binde himselfe to make lawes alwayes by their assent. But because it would require an intire treatise to speake sufficiently of this subject, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it can no way prejudice the cause in hand if we grant Parliaments as they are now moulded to be by fundamentall agreement, seeing ihe King by the lawes of the lande, and the said fundamentall agreement, is invested, as hath been shewed, with all the rights of Soveraigntie, I will lay by many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and omit many reasons and passages which I could alleadge touching this matter.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, if the Nobility and people be then, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50355:61"/> onely then, coordinate with the King, vvhen they are in their site, relation, order, and union, in Parliament, as the fuller Answerer affirmeth; in time of Parliament the Kingdome should be a <hi>Head</hi> vvithout a <hi>Body:</hi> For if the King be part of the <hi>Head,</hi> and the whole Nobility part of the <hi>Head,</hi> and all the People part of the <hi>Head</hi> too, vvhere is the <hi>Body?</hi> And on the other side in the vacancy of Parliaments, the Kingdome should be a <hi>Body</hi> vvithout a <hi>Head:</hi> For if the Nobility and people he onely then coordinate when they are in their site, relation, order, and union in Parliament, after a Parliament be broken up, vvhere is the <hi>Head?</hi> For as the preservation of the vvhole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the order and union of its partes, so the dissolution of it follovveth their separation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. If this opinion then vvere true, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth should be a strainge deformed <hi>monster;</hi> for in time of Parliament, vvhen all the <hi>Body</hi> vvere a <hi>Head,</hi> it should be <hi>monstrous</hi> by too much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and out of Parliament, vvhen tvvo partes of the <hi>Head</hi> vvere fallen into the <hi>Body,</hi> it should be <hi>monstrous</hi> by too little: In both cases is should want that beauty and comlinesse which consists in the harmony and proportion of severall partes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if we discend into particulars, we shall find Parliaments to be so moulded, that their frame and composition rendereth the two houses an unmeet subject for supreamacy; for the Militia, the povver
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50355:61"/> of making vvarre or peace vvith forraigne princes, and most of the other rightes of Soveraigntie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a subject perpetually existent; many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionall accidents may arise that may call for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and sudden use of the supreame povver, for vvhich there can be no provision made by bodies not existent.</p>
               <p>I could adde much more, both from the statutes, Common law, and reason, as well concerning the Kings supreamacy in generall, as concerning the particular rightes of Soveraigntie: But I presume that which hath been said is more then sufficient, not onely to satisfy all that are indifferent and neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall, but to convince those that are most inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed, vvho shall not easily find shiftes and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions plausible enough to illude such cleare testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of lavv. But God onely is able to change their heartes, and to make such impressions there as can cause them to repent and turne from their evill vvayes; I shall pray continually he vvould do it, as vvell in regard of the peace and happinesse of the Kingdome, as of their ovvne salvation, vvhich I can not othervvise hope they should obtaine; For vvhatsoever deceivs them, and bears up their spirits for a time, repentance at last, (if God give them grace) vvill prove their best fortune.</p>

               <p>THe Kings supreamacy being made apparent I shall now proceed to answer their obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which yet are of that nature that they deserve more to be contemned then answered: for in stead of law they alleadge <hi>Bedas</hi> axioms, their owne fancies, and such other impertinencies, as one would thinke should Sooner move a man to laughter, then to be of their opinion. But because they shall not complaine that their objections are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50355:62"/> concealed, and because in answering them I shall further confirme the Kings supreamacy, I will bring them all in order, not suppressing or omitting any thing that hath but the face of an objection, how slight and impertinent soever. I will beginne with that which is alleadged by the two pretended houses themselves, whose most remarkable objections are these which follow, being the summe and substance of that which they say in all their declarations touching matter of right, in this particular. <hi>The Kings supreamacy is meant</hi> in Curia non in Camera <hi>in his courtes not in his private capacity, and to speake properly, onely in his high court of Parliament, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he is absolutely supreame head and governour, from which their is no appeal. And if the Parliament may take an account what is done by his Majesty in his inferiour courtes, much more what is done by him without authority in any court. And it is preached to the people in the Kinges declarations, that by the supreamacy is meant a power inherent in the Kings person, without, above, against all his courtes the Parliament not excepted, whereby the excellent lawes are turned into an arbitrary government.</hi> Argus eyes will Scarse be able to discover a worde of lavv or truth in all this, every sentence seemeth rather to be a Sarcasme then to conteine matter of serious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, wherein they deale with his Majesty, as the Iewes did vvith our <hi>saviour Christ,</hi> who having stripped him of his apparrel, and used all the spitefull
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50355:63"/> and opprobrions tearmes they could devise against him, added at last a mocke to their other in civilities bowing unto him, and saying, <hi>HAYLE KING OF THE IEWES.</hi> The two pretended houses having likevvise seized upon all his Majesties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and rightes of the Crovvne, and offered him all the indignities they could invent, do yet stile him their <hi>King, and supream head and governour,</hi> but in such a manner, as they may seem, like the <hi>Iewes,</hi> rather to doe it by vvay of derision then in earnest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings supreamacy,</hi> they say, <hi>is meant</hi> in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria non in Camera, <hi>in his Courtes not in his private capacity.</hi> As they fancy the people to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed all authority to the King, so they fancy the King to have poured it out againe into his courtes, as if he had no povver, authority, or jurisdiction, adherent in his person, but had committed all to his delegate Iudges, or rather (vvhich they say is <hi>to speake properly</hi>) unto themselves: vvhereas he hath by lavv a royall and superimenent jurisdiction above all his courtes,<note place="margin">Manwoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Archeion fol. 95. <hi>I shall not need to repeat that which I have before this time opened, touching the beginning of the Kingly power and authority, for the delivery of justice to all the sortes, and in all the suites of his subjects, but I will confirme by prooses drawne
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50355:63"/> out of our country lawes, and lawyers that the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same generall jurisdiction is appropriated to all the Kinges of this realme of England. Master</hi> Henry Bracton <hi>that lived in the time of King</hi> Henry <hi>the third hath in the ninth and tenth chapter of his booke these words following:</hi> Rex (&amp; non alius) debet judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, si solus ad id sufficere possit, cum ad hoc per veritatem Sacramenti teneatur astrictus, exercere igitur debet Rex potestatem juris, sicut Dei Vicarius &amp; minister in terra. Sin Dominus Rex ad singulas causas determinandas non sufficiat, ut levior sit illi labor in plures personas partito onere, eligere debet viros sapientes, &amp; timentes Deum, &amp; ex illis consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere justiciarios. <hi>The wordes do prove two thinges serviceable to this purpose: first, that the King ought onely to be the judge of his people, if he alone were able to performe that office, as well because he is within his owne Kingdome the vice-Roy of God (the supreame judge of the world) as also for that he is thereunto bounde by oath, taken at the Coronation. The second that albeit he doe (for the multitud of causes) substitute others underneath him, yet is he not thereby dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himselfe; for it is done</hi> ut levior sit illi labor <hi>that his labour be the lighter, not that he should sit unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied; and least you should doubt that so much is not comprised in that oath of his, one question therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others is this:</hi> Facies fieri in omnibus judiciis tuis aequam, &amp; rectam justitiam, &amp; discretionem in misericordia, &amp; veritate secundum vires tuas: <hi>To
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50355:64"/> which he answereth,</hi> faciam: <hi>wherin the wordes</hi> judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciis tuis, &amp; vires tuas, <hi>doe more properly denote his owne doing, then the doing of his subalterne justices; albeit their judgement be after a certaine manner, the judgement of the King himselfe also, from vvhence their authority is derived. Much like the wordes of</hi> Bracton <hi>speaketh King</hi> Edward <hi>the first in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his booke of lawes commonly called</hi> Britton: <hi>where after he had shevved that he is the Vicar of God, and that he hath distributed his charge into sundry portions, because he alone is not sufficient to heare and determine all complaintes of his people; then he addeth these wordes:</hi> Nous volons que nostre jurisdiction soit sur touts jurisdictions en nostre realme: issent que in touts maners de felonies, tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, contracts, &amp; en touts maners de autres actions personals, ou real, ayons poer a rendre &amp; faire ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre les jugements tiels come ils afferont, sans auter processe, par la ou nous sçavons la droit verite come judges. <hi>We will,</hi> saith the King, <hi>that our owne juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be above all the jurisdiction of our realme: so as in all manner of felonies, trespasses, contracts, and in all other actions personalls, or realls, we have povver to yeald (or cause to yeald) such judgements as do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine (without other processe) vvheresoever vve know the right truth, as judges. Neyther may this be taken to be meant of the Kings bench, vvhere there is onely an imaginary presence of his person; but it must necessarily be understoode of a jurisdiction remaining
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50355:64"/> and left in the Kings Royall bodie and breast distinct from that of his Bench, Marshalsey, Common pleas, exchequer, and the other ordinary courtes: because he doth immediatly after, in the same place severally set forth by themselves, as vvell the authority of the Kinges Bench, as of the rest of those his ordinarie Courtes of justice. And that this vvas no nevv made lavv, or first brought in by the Normane conquest, I must put you in minde of that vvhich I touched before, out of the Saxon lavves of King Edgar, vvhere you did read it thus:</hi> Nemo in lite Regem appellato, nisi quando domi jus consequi non poterit, sin juris summi onere domi prematur, ad regem ut is id oneris allevet, provocato: <hi>Let no man in suit appeale to the King unlesse he may not get right at home; but if that right be too heavy for him, goe to the King to have it eased. By vvhich it may evidently appeare, that even so many yeares agoe there might appellation be made to the Kings Person, vvhensoever the cause should inforce it.</hi> Hitherto Mr. Lambart; who doth afterwards further prove this supreame and supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent jurisdiction of the King by divers presidents and acts of Parliament. And although the Commons in some other Parliaments have seemed to impugne this Prerogative, yet here, as he saith,<note place="margin">Fol. 125.</note>
                  <hi>the Kings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes most gravely and considerately repelled that sort of attempt.</hi> The Kings supreamacy then is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his <hi>Person</hi> not in his <hi>Courtes,</hi> as the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended houses affirme; for his politique capacity
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50355:65"/> can not be seperated from his naturall, but what power soever he maketh over unto his <hi>Courtes,</hi> the same and greater remaineth in <hi>Himselfe;</hi> His autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not separated from him by such a concession <hi>privitivè</hi> but <hi>Cumulativè</hi> onely as <hi>Civilians</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in Concessions of like nature made by the <hi>Emperour;</hi> who give these reasons for the ground of their law, not much different from those alleadged by <hi>Lambart</hi> out of <hi>Bracton</hi> and others. <hi>Credendum non est Imperatorem ita fontes suos derivasse forâs ut ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil penes se remanserit; sed in quavis concessione sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per authoritas &amp; persona ejus excepta censetur: quis enim tam stolidus ut alii benefaciendo seipsum consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere velit, cum etiam Principis sit, &amp; ad officium ejus proprie pertineat jus dicere Knichen. d. superiorit. territ. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Wurms. exercit.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 15. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sental. d. feud. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>conclus.</hi> 13. <hi>Pruckman. d.

It is not to be imagined that the Emperour should so empty his fountaines as to leave nothing in himselfe; but it is to be conceived that in every concession his owne Person and authority is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, for who is such a foole to consume himselfe by doing good to others, it is also the essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and office of a Prince, to doe justice.</p>
               <p>The pretended houses proceed; <hi>And to speake properly onely his high court of Parliament wherein he is absolutely supreame head and governour from which there is no appeale.</hi> They Speake not more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50355:65"/> properly as they say, but much more improperly then they did before; it is the same authority that is in all his courtes and in his Person too, though not all the same authority; for it is limited and restrained in his courtes by commission, writ, or law; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as those limitations and restrictions are more or lesse, so may courtes be said to have a greater or lesse jurisdiction, but not the King to be more or lesse supreame: nor is their expression improper onely, but also full of falshood and deceit; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas they say <hi>there can be no appleale from the high court of Parliament,</hi> they desire the people should so construe theire wordes, as to thinke the two houses could jointly by reason of the Kings virtuall presence take cognizance of a plea, and give judgement upon it, from which theire could be no appeale; which had they spoke out their falshood had been transparent. for onely the Lords house is a court of judicature, and from thence appeales may be made to the King who may and have reformed the undue proceedings of that court; for <hi>anno</hi> 18. <hi>Edward.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Lambarts Archeion fol. 133.</note>
                  <hi>Bogo de Clare</hi> being discarged of an accusation put against him in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for some imperfections of forme that were discovered in the complaint, the King commanded him neverthelesse to appeare before himselfe <hi>ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum &amp; recipiendum quod per Regem &amp; ejus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium fuerit faciendum</hi> and so proceeded to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination of the whole cause. Neyther is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of their wordes truer then the latter; the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50355:66"/> Kings supreamacy they say to speake properly <hi>is onely in his high court of Parliament.</hi> This in their sence is false; the supreamacy of the King is no more in his high court of Parliament by reason of his virtuall presence or politique capacity, then in his other <hi>Courtes,</hi> when he is personally there his suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy then together with his <hi>Person</hi> is in the <hi>Court,</hi> not otherwise. For I have shewed already in divers places that the rights of Soveraigntie are not onely individually inherent in his <hi>Person,</hi> but so insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly also annexed unto it that they can not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to others by any grant or concession made by himselfe in private, or by an act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Lib. 7. in Calvinet case.</note> I shall now adde, that their conceit is called in <hi>Cokes reports</hi> a damnable and damned opinion, and hath been at large confuted, and condemned, by all the judges, as is there related; it was first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>Spencers,</hi> who to cover their treason, sayd that homage and the oath of ligeance was more by reason of the Kings Crowne, that is by reason of his politique capacity then by reason of the <hi>Person</hi> of the King: from which opinion they inferred these detestable consequences. 1. If the King doe not demeane himself by reason his Leiges are bound by oath to remove him. 2. Seeing the King could not be reformed by suit of law, that ought to be done <hi>per aspertee.</hi> 3. that his Lieges are bound to governe in ayde of him, all which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by two Parliaments, one in the Reigne

For when the King is not personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is his courtes, he can be there by reason of his politique capacity no other wayes but by virtuall emanation; there can be in them no more authority then is delegated and committed to his judges: Now it is a common conception as evident as the first principles, that a delegate power can not be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame. A King may alienate and resigne up supreame authority, but he can not delegate it; In how generall tearmes soever, say <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> authority be granted by the <hi>Concessour</hi> to the <hi>concessary</hi> supreame authority can not be comprised under those tearmes. <hi>Quocunque modo Regalium concessio fiat, nihilominus superius illud &amp; Majestaticum imperium, ea largitione nunquam cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seatur comprehensum, sed potius major semper, quam est concessa, reservata &amp; retenta putetur potestas. cap, Dudum. §. hoc igitur de praebend. in</hi> 6. <hi>l. inquisitio.

               <p>They adde further, <hi>And if the Parliament may take an account vvhat is done by his Majesty in his inferiour courtes, much more what is done by him without authority in any court.</hi> This <hi>if</hi> is well put in; they say not categorically they may take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what is done by his Majesty in his inferiour courtes, yet they vvould have the people thinke them to have such a povver; and therefore they lay it downe as a supposition vvhich they seeme to take for granted, although they knovv it to be false: for they may take an account vvhat is done in his courtes by subordinate Officers and Ministers, but not vvhat is done by his Majesty, vvho as King can no more doe vvrong then God can be the authour of sinne; His authority is from God, and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice be committed in his courtes his Kingly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not the cause thereof, but the corruption of his judges vvho abuse it; and his Majesty may take an account of them eyther privately, or in his Parliament, but is not himselfe accountable for their abuses. For although the judgement of his courtes may and is tearmed in law the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, yet that is to be understood of the act it selfe, which can not be effected without his influence and concurrence; not of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and deviation from justice vvhich is in it.

Enough hath been said already to prove them to be his inferiour dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and subordinate ministers, that derive their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from him, and in case of grievance are to sue unto him by petition, which is all the help the law giveth in such exigencies; for they are so farre from having any jurisdiction over him in matters of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deamenour, that they can not take knowledge of those cases wherein Majesty without disparagement may submit it selfe to a legall triall as in controversies of right, or of title to land, &amp;c. except he be pleased to have the buisinesse decided in that court. In <hi>Haedlows</hi> case before mentioned, it is resolved by all the justices, that controversies which concerne the King can not be determined in Parliament;<note place="margin">22.

               <p>Last of all they charge the King for attributing too much povver and authority to himselfe. <hi>And it is preached to the people in the Kings declarations that by the Supreamacy is meant a power inherent in the Kings</hi> Person <hi>without, above, against all his</hi> courtes,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50355:68"/>
                  <hi>the</hi> Parliament <hi>not excepted, whereby the excellent lawes are turned into an arbitrary Government.</hi> It is no wonder if the pretended houses were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to heare what their owne seditious divines preached in <hi>Saint Margerets,</hi> then what the King preached in his declarations; they which sustaine such a cause, can no more endure to heare, then to speake the truth: yet I beleeve it had beene better for them if they had entertained his Majesties <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> with more respect and dutie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the present they seem to have ruined him and his people too, and to have advanced their owne interest by the ruine of them both; Yet they which have mounted to places of dignity and profit upon the dead bodies of the King and people, may finde in the ende, that <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Murder</hi> sit not so high, but that <hi>vengeance</hi> and divine <hi>Iustice</hi> sit above them. As for the charge which they bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesty, it is partly false; his Majesty never used such expressions as they pinne upon him: where doth he say that he hath a personall power above and against the Parliament? let any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the wordes out of which he can force such a sence. He is himselfe in <hi>Person</hi> head of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to say that he hath a Personall Power above and against himselfe were to speake as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, as the pretended houses use to speake in their owne declarations, which his Majesty is not guilty of. Theire charge is also partly vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50355:69"/> for whereas they accuse him for saying his supreamacy was inherent in his <hi>Person,</hi> they might as well accuse him for saying he was King: Suprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is an essentiall attribute of Majesty, and can not be separated without the corruption of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; to say the Kings supreamacy is in his courtes and not in his person, is not onely to contradict the lawes, but the Common principles of reason. This hath been demonstrated in divers places, yet because occasion is offered againe, I will here adde the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all the Iudges made in the first yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh concerning this matter; for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being then called, and both the King himselfe, and divers of the Members, being attainded of high treason, it was resolved by the Iudges that the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Members ought to be adnulled before they could sit in the house: but touching the King it was resolved, that his attaindor was adnulled upon his admittance to the crowne, because <hi>the King is personable,</hi> that is, because his Kingly authority was inherent in his <hi>Person,</hi> by reason whereof he was discharged of all guilt against the lawes. <hi>Et donques fuit move un question que serra dit pur le Roy mesme pur ceo que il fuit atteint,</hi>

It is likewise shewed that the King hath not onely an absolute jurisdiction in cases ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, which can have remedy no where else; but ordinary also, above all his courtes wherein he is but virtually present; yet for further illustration of the truth, I will here call to remembrance two places of <hi>Bracton</hi> alleadged before for other purposes, yet serving also to confirme the Kings ordinary juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The first is <hi>Sicut Dominus Papa in spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus super omnibus habeat ordinariam jurisdictionem, ita habet Rex in Regno suo ordinariam in temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp; pares non habet, neque superiores.</hi>

               <p>THe Author of the treatise of Monarchy, the fuller Answerer, and other pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians, have invented a new forme of Government to delude the people, which they tell them is the Government estabished in England; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely a <hi>mixed Monarchy,</hi> consisting of three estates, independent for their authority upon on another,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50355:70"/> all of them being coordinate, and having severall shares in the rights of Soveraigntie, by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lawes of the lande. A strange kinde of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,</hi> not so much as heard of untill these times, much lesse established in England: for a <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the Government of <hi>one alone,</hi> as the Etymologie of the worde importeth; now to say the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>three Estates,</hi> is the Government of <hi>One alone,</hi> doth not sound halfe handsomly. Other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours have spoken of <hi>mixed Government,</hi> and <hi>mixed commonwealths,</hi> but of <hi>mixed Monarchy</hi> in that sence which they doe, none but themselves have treated. For according to the verdict of other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, when Monarchie, Aristocratie,<note place="margin">Besol. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. polit. doct. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, are melted and alayed together, that which resulteth can take its name from none of the simple species or kinds of Government, although the chiefe authority, or primity of share belong to ony one of the estates: it is a solecisme to call him a Monarch who hath not all the rightes of soveraigntie, and who hath them not alone;<note place="margin">Besol. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> where more then one do sway the affaires of State, and have amongst them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon empire, the forme of Government is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyarchicall. Yet if they will needs have a mixed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be denominated from that kinde that hath predominancy, they might vvith better reason have called their new frame a mixed <hi>Democratie;</hi> this denomination (besids that it is not so improper as the other, <hi>Democratie,</hi> implying the Govenment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50355:71"/> of the <hi>people,</hi> but not of the <hi>people onely,</hi> as Monarchie doth of the <hi>Monarch alone</hi>) is more agreable to the quality and nature of their platforme; for the Kings authority being so inconsiderable as they make it, the people in this mixture must needs be the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant element. The Author of the <hi>treatise of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie</hi> who seemeth to give most to the King, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in tearmes he grants him a primity of share in the supreame power, yet in substance he would have it placed in the two houses, attributing unto them such authority, as they may thereby make him deprivable at their pleasure. Now although the said <hi>Treatiser</hi> seemeth to be a <hi>Poet</hi> rather then a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> having many new fictions, but scarsly a worde of law in all his treatise, yet because I can not conveniently reduce his objections to any of the other questions that are hereafter to be discussed, I will answer them in this place: But before I come to examine them, that all things may be cleare, and better understoode, I will, for perspicuity sake, speak a word or two of the diuision and severall Kindes of <hi>Absolute, Limited,</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I will beginne with <hi>Absolute</hi> Government of which there be three kindes; the first is <hi>Absolute</hi> both in respect of power and also in respect of the use and exercise of it. In this kinde of Government the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame governours have perfect, <hi>Absolute,</hi> full, and intire power; and in the exercise of it are subject to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50355:71"/> no limitation made by any humane law, paction, or agreement, but are limited <hi>ab externo</hi> by the lawes of God and nature onely, being otherwise left to the free determination of their owne wills. This is also called <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Government, not because such Governours as have the free use of their power may doe what they please; for their power is bounded by the lawes of God and nature, and may not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse and goe beyond its limits: but because it is not bounded by any humane positive law made to restraine and regulate it. The ends of Government may be attained severall wayes in many particulars without breach of the Lawes of God and nature; now when a Governour is not directed to his end in any of those particulars by humane constitution and appointement, but hath an open and free passage to act which way he please, his Government is <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> Amongst all the severall kindes of Government this onely is <hi>jure Divino,</hi> as being more ancient then any humane law that could be made to direct it, by vertue and authority whereof, humane lawes were at first enacted; all other sortes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the policy of men, yet lawfull, humane Constitutions serving to conduct power to its end; making as it were a furrow, for it to passe in, and to conteine it, which otherwise is apt to overflow its bounds, and to degenerate into tyranny. The second is <hi>Absolute</hi> in respect of the power alone; In this kinde of Government the Supreame Governours
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50355:72"/> have as perfect, <hi>Absolute,</hi> full, and intire power as the former, their authority have the same latitud, and all the same dimensions; but they are limited <hi>ab externo</hi> in the use and exercise of it, eyther by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and fundamentall constitution, or else by lawes made aftervvards by speciall grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention: so that although their povver be perfect, <hi>Absolute,</hi> full, and intire, in all respects, and able to produce all the effects of Government, yet they can not put it forth, and act by it according to their ovvne free election, or according to the full activity of it, but must act according to those limitations made and granted by lavv. The third is <hi>Absolute</hi> in respect of the exercise onely; In this kinde of Government the supreame authority is committed for a certaine time, but not translated, to one or more, vvho by vertue of the said commission may exercise the povver in an <hi>arbitrary</hi> manner during the time assigned them. Such vvere the <hi>Dictators</hi> of the <hi>Romane Commonwealth,</hi> vvho ruled as <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> all the time of their <hi>Dictatorshipe,</hi> as the most <hi>Absolute</hi> Monarchs in the vvorld, yet the supreame authority remained in the <hi>Senate:</hi> And such are they vvho exercise Royall povver in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes vvhose Government is <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are also three kindes of <hi>Limited</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ansvvereable to absolute; the first is <hi>Limited</hi> both in respect of Povver, and also in respect of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50355:72"/> use and exercise of it; In this kinde of Government there are alvvayes more Governours then one, vvhich are all <hi>Limited</hi> in the very essence and being of their povver, having none of them perfect, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, full and intire authority, but onely their severall shares and proportion: neyther can they act in an arbitrary manner according to the full extent of that povver vvhich they have, but have a certaine rule set them by lavv. The second is <hi>Limited</hi> in respect of the povver alone; In this kinde of Government as in the former there are alvvayes more Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours then one vvhich have all their <hi>Limited</hi> shares, yet may all act arbitrarily eyther joyntly together, or every one within the <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> of his ovvne authority. The third is <hi>Limited</hi> in respect of the exercise onely; In this kinde of Government, the Governours are absolute in regard of power, but circumscribed and Limited in the Acts of it.</p>
               <p>As of absolute and limited so there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise three kinds of <hi>Mixed</hi> Government sutable to the other; the first is <hi>Mixed</hi> both in respect of power and also in respect of the use and exercise of it. In this kinde of Government there is a mixture of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall powers which compound and make up one perfect, absolute, ful, and intire power; and also of severall persons, and estates, to vvhome the said powers do radically and fundamentally perteine, vvhich do jointly concurre in rhe administration and exercise of them. The Second is <hi>Mixed</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50355:73"/> of the povver alone; In this kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment severall persons and estates are mixed together in the possession of povver, but one alone do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise all the acts of Soveraigntie, In this manner vvas the <hi>Roman Commonwealth</hi> governed by <hi>Sylla;</hi> and by <hi>Dictators</hi> in the time of exigence and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. The third is <hi>Mixed</hi> in respect of the exercise onely; In this kinde of Government severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and estates are <hi>Mixed</hi> in the exercise of power, but one of the estates alone hath the dominion, and propriety of it.</p>
               <p>Novv touching the Government of <hi>England,</hi> I have shevved already that it is Monarchicall, that the Monarchie is <hi>Absolute,</hi> in respect of the <hi>power;</hi> that the King alone hath perfect, <hi>Absolute,</hi> full, and intire jurisdiction, able if put in action, to effectuate, and bring to passe, all the endes of Government: and that all other persons, of all estates and degrees vvhatsoever, both Nobles, and Commons, move in their severall circuits, and spheres of activity, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall emanation from him, and not by force of any povver, authority, or jurisdiction inherent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And indeed all Monarchies are <hi>Absolute</hi> in this respect; that is, in respect of the povver, for vvhen the limitation is in the essence and being of povver, Monarchie is destroyed, not limited.</p>
               <p>But yet the English Monarchie is <hi>Limited</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the use and exercise of povver, the King being obliged to govern according to the lavves of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50355:73"/> the lande, vvhich although they doe not diminish Majesty <hi>in essentialibus,</hi> yet they do diversly qualify, and modificate it. It is also <hi>Mixed</hi> in the same respect, the King being obliged in some cases not to use his power without the assent and concurrence of the two other estates. The pretended Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, on the other side, deny the English Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie to be <hi>Absolute</hi> in any respect; and affirme it to be <hi>Limited,</hi> and <hi>Mixed,</hi> as well in respect of the power it selfe, as in respect of the use and exercise thereof, the two houses of Parliament being coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with the King, not onely in the administration of power, but in the possession of it. Yet they are not able to alleadge one sillable of law to make good these strainge novelties, but strive by indirect inferences to deceive the people. Howsoever I will bring their objections, such as they are, and answer them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and first I vvill bring their objections vvhereby they endeavour to prove their pretended limitation, and then those vvhereby they endeavour to prove their pretended mixture.</p>
               <p>

                  </label> for if his heart and his tongue goe together, if he be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as he saith in his first objection, that the King by his Counsell knevv the nature of his ovvne povver best, why hath he acted contrary to his Majesties declarations? vvhy hath he, against his conscience, affirmed it to be lavvfull for the tvvo houses to take up armes against him? he knovvs his Majesty vvas never of that opinion. Novv to his objections I say that the second, and fift, proceede
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50355:75"/> upon his ovvne principles, namely, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of England is mixed in the povver it selfe, and that the Legislative povver is not in the King alone, but jointly in the three estates: If these principles vvere true his objections vvere materiall; but I have shevved the contrary, and shall yet shevv it further hereafter. In his other three objections he doth not so much as touch the question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; he layeth dovvne this conclusion to be proved, <hi>That the Kings Soveraigntie is radically and fundamentally Limited, and not onely in the use and exercise of it,</hi> but endeavoureth to prove no more then that it is limited in generall, vvithout specifying vvhether radically and in the essence and being of it, or in the exercise onely. A legall moderation and limitation of Royall povver, as farre as I knovv, is denyed by none, although the Treatiser be pleased to lay a false imputation upon some Divines, because they hould it not limited in the same manner vvhich he hath represented it: The Kings Soveraigntie to be radically and fundamentally limited, and not onely in the use and exercise of it, is, in the sence by him explained, to be so limited, that his Majesty shall not onely be restrained in the use and exercise of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame povver, but shall also be stinted in his share of it, and have no more then a single parte, tvvo other partes of the said povver belonging to the other estates. Novv that he may deceive the people, he maketh a shevv as if he had gained his purpose
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50355:75"/> by proving the Kings power to be limited in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, whereas he knoweth well enough that there is a great difference betweene being limited, and being so limited by law. The Kings power to be measured and limited by law, includs no more then that his power is of such a size and bignesse as the law hath ordained; if the law giveth him perfect, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, full, and intire power, and limits him onely in the exercise of it, this is a restraint and limitation according to law, yet not in the essence and being of power. And indeed this is the true and onely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Monarchie, whereby the Monarchs power is limited <hi>ab externo</hi> by humane lawes and constitutions, and not by the free and arbitrary reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of his owne vvill, and yet Monarchie preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved intire. But vvhen the rightes of Soveraigntie are divided and placed in severall Estates vvhich limit one another, such a limitation is inconsistent with Monarchie. But the Treatiser objecteth further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this answer, that where the limitation of power is onely in the exercise of it and not in the povver it selfe, all acts of Government are resolved at last into the arbitrary vvill of the Monarch: for although he be limited in the exercise of povver by lavv, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, yet if he vvill conrrary to lavv and promise sinfully put it forth, his povver is authoritative and may not be resisted: this is the full scope and summe of that which he replieth to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> vvith no small ostentation. <hi>A legall restraint,</hi> saith he, <hi>you seem
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50355:76"/> to acknowledge;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note>
                  <hi>but such an one as resolve into the arbitrary will of the Monarch, as I have made it appeare in my former treatise, which you will never be able to wipe of by this or any other reply.</hi> If this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply were strictly examined it would appeare farre unworthy such boasts and braggs as are brought to set it out; but I shall onely in breefe shew the insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of it, and so let it passe. First therefore I say that we do by this assertion no more resolve Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, then he resolves his mixed Commonwealth, into an arbitrary Government. For although in a mixed Government every one of the estates hath but a limited share, yet taken together they have perfect, absolute, full, and intire power, which if they will contrary to law or promise sinnefully put forth, it is as authoritative and unresistible as if it were in one man. He will grant, I suppose, the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be equall in all commonwealths, and that there can be no essentiall but onely an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall difference between them; for all common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths have a sufficiency of power to attaine to all the ends of Government, and to make provision for all occurrencies, which can not be otherwise limited then in the exercise: This he confesseth in an other place; for disputing about the limitation of power in the essence and being therof, and having made an objection against it, in answering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection he saith, <hi>such a limitation can not be where power is supream,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note>
                  <hi>but for limitation to a rule and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50355:76"/> vvay of working, I can not see hovv it withstands the end of Government,</hi> which, if I doe rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his meaning, is the same in other tearmes that he confutes in Doctor <hi>Fern,</hi> and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly conclude that the povver of Government taken <hi>in sua latitudine</hi> can not be limited in the essence and being of it, but in the use and exercise onely; for, to be limited to a rule ad defined way of working is to be limited in the exercise, but not in the essence of power. If then all acts of Government are resolved into the arbitrary will of the Governours where the limitation of power is onely in the exercise of it, doth he not himselfe resolve his mixed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth into an arbitrary Government? But secondly I say, that to limit power in the exercise of it, is so farre from resolving all cases into the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will of the Governour, that it is the onely way and means to restraine arbitrarinesse: the limitation of power in the essence and being of it alone, is not sufficient to restraine it; for vvhen a power is limited in its essence and being, and terminated onely within its owne intrinsique boundes, such a limitation is opposed to an <hi>Infinite,</hi> but not to an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. When the three Estates have all their limited shares, yet they may all act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> according to the extent of that power which they have, not onely when they act joyntly together, but in the administration of their severall charges, if their power be not regulated by law in the exercise of it;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50355:77"/> it is not the limitation of power therefore in the essence and being of it, but in the exercise, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominats and constituts a limited Government. Power which is limited in the essence and being of it onely, although it can not act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> in so great a latitud as when it is intire and absolute, yet it may act <hi>arbitrarily</hi> within its owne bounds if it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined onely by the will of him that acteth by it, and not by a certaine rule of law. Besids the former obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the Treatiser in his reply to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> hath added others which proceed upon one of their owne principles, namely that all authority and power is originally in the people, from whence he inferreth that they may translate as much and as little as they please to their Governours, and so limit their power in its being and essence. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they speake not <hi>de facto</hi> but <hi>de possibili,</hi> and because I shall handle these things <hi>ex proposito</hi> in the third question, I will referre them to their due place.</p>

                  <hi>I conceive it,</hi> saith the Treatiser, <hi>a cleare and undoubted truth, that the Authority of the land is of a compounded and mixed nature in the very roote and constitution thereof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answer to the 19. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</note>
                  <hi>and my judgement is established on these grounds. First, it is acknowledged to be a Monarchie mixed with Aristocracy in the house of peers, and democracy in the house of Commons.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50355:77"/> Now (as before was made appeare in the first part) it is no mixture which is not in the roote and supremacy of power: For though it hath a subordination of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour officers, and though the powers inferiour be seated in a mixed subject, yet that maks it not a mixed Government; for it is compatible to the simplest in the world to have subordinate mixtures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majesty acknowledgeth Monarchie to be so mixed with Aristocratie and Democratie in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of some part of his power, that the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of all those formes of Government, without the inconveniences of any of them, are obtained by such a mixture; But he denieth the mixture to be in the power it selfe, for the convenience which he saith it hath from Monarchie, is, that it is Governed by <hi>one Head:</hi> Where by <hi>one Head,</hi> he meaneth not, <hi>one</hi> by mixture, but <hi>one</hi> single Person, <hi>one</hi> pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed subject, that hath all power and authority alone. The Treatiser, I conceive, hath purposely omitted his wordes, that his sence might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; but I shall cite them in the next chapter, and shew the true intention and meaning of them. Now whereas his Majesty hath acknowledged a mixture, to inferre from thence that he granted the mixture to be in the power it selfe, because the other kinde is not a true, but an improper kinde of mixture, is a strainge and unusuall way of argumentation. If his Majesty was in an errour, and apprehended that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50355:78"/> to be a true mixture, vvhich is not, all that can be concluded thereupon, is, that he misunderstoode the true nature of mixture, not that he granted the mixture to be such as they contend for; vvhen it is evident that a man deny a thing <hi>in terminis,</hi> there is neither candour nor ingenuity in those, vvhich will by consequences argue him to affirme it: Some accuse the <hi>Romane Catholiques</hi> of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> because they affirme such things, as in their conceit seeme by way of consequence to allow it; but no man was ever so voyd of ingenuity as to dispute the question <hi>whether Idolatrie be lavvfull,</hi> and then cite them for <hi>Authours</hi> that maintaine it to be lavvfull: In like manner some accuse <hi>Calvine</hi> of <hi>Turcisme,</hi> because he affirme such things, as in their conceit seeme by vvay of consequence to justify the practice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Turcks;</hi> but no man was ever so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable as to dispute the question <hi>vvhether the Turckish religion be the true religion,</hi> and then cite him for an <hi>Authour</hi> that maintained it to be true; because it is evident that if those questions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>in terminis,</hi> the <hi>Romane Catholiques</hi> would deny <hi>Idolatry to be lavvfull;</hi> and <hi>Calvine,</hi> if he were alive, <hi>the Turckish religion to be the true religion,</hi> what consequences soever other men draw from their wordes. Yet the Treatiser dealeth in this manner with his Majesty; for although it be evident, that his Majesty denied, <hi>in terminis,</hi> the mixture of the English Monarchie <hi>to be in the povver it selfe,</hi> yet he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50355:78"/> argues him by consequences to affirme it: this to the Antecedent. But secondly the consequent is also false; the mistake is in himselfe not in his Majesty: vvhy is it no mixture, vvhich is not in the roote and supreamacy of povver? he ansvvereth, <hi>Though it hath a subordination of inferiour officers, and though the powers inferiour be seated in a mixed subject, yet that maks it not a mixed Government; for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to the simplest in the world to have subordinate mixtures,</hi> vvhat if no Goverment in the vvorld be so perfectly simple as to exclude all subordinate mixtures? it doth not follovv from thence, that <hi>it is no mixture which is not in the roote and supreamacy of power,</hi> but the contrary; for a subordinate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a mixture. I shall also deny the very ground and foundation of his argument; such subordinate mixtures, as are in the English Monarchie, are not compatible to the simplest Government in the vvorld, for vvhere the Government is arbitrary and absolute both in respect of povver, and in respect also of the use and exercise of it, supreame Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours can put forth all the actes of povver and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction alone; they can make lavves, rayse taxes, and exercise their vvhole povver, according to the full activity of it, vvithout the concurrence of the other estates: and although they do often make use of their direction and assistance, yet this mixture in the exercise of povver proceeds not from the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Government, but from their ovvne
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50355:79"/> voluntary election, choosing this as the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible means to obtaine the endes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For although they may act according to the full activity of their povver, yet they can not act in person at all times and in all places, nor is one mans vvisdome sufficient to meet vvith all the Events and accidents of Government, by reason vvhereof they are driven to seeke a remedy against such inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences as vvould arise from these and the like causes; and if, vvhen they find no better, they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute others and give them authority to act vvith them in the exercise of povver, this voluntary mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can not have such an effect as to denominate a Government mixed, because it depende upon the the immediate vvill of the supreame Governour, vvho may rule and actuate all his intentions and purposes vvithout them, vvhere and vvhen he please: and vvhether he acts vvith them, or vvithout them, the frame of Government is still the same; for it is the constitution of a Government that specificate it, and causeth it to be denominated mixed, or simple. And therefore vvhereas the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser saith <hi>though the powers inferiour be seated in a mixed subject, yet that maks it not a mixed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> this is false vvhen the povvers inferiour are seated in a mixed subject by the constitution of the Government, and not by the immediate vvill of the supreame governour. There is a great difference then betvveen such subordinate mixtures, and the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50355:79"/> mixture that is in the English Monarchie, those are mutable, uncertaine, depending upon the will of the Supreame Governour, this immutable, certaine, depending upon the constitution of the Government: for whether it vvas effected by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall contract vvith the people at the first foundation of the Monarchy, or whether it vvas established af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvard by the voluntary grant and concession of some of our Kings, or vvhether it vvas introduced by custome, the Government is now so constituted, that the King can not make lawes, rayse subsidies, or exercise some other acts of his povver, vvithout the assent of the two other estates. So that the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Government is mixed in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, namely in respect of the exercise of some acts of povver, vvhich happeneth not in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths vvhere the Government is arbitrary. Besids that vvhich is here alleadged, the Treatiser bringeth other objections in his reply to Doctor <hi>Fern,</hi> against mixture in the use and exercise of povver. <hi>Aristocracy and Democracy,</hi> saith he, <hi>are powers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note>
                  <hi>not Persons, as well as Monarchy: therefore a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these three must be all of powers, and endeed this</hi> Chimera <hi>of a mixture in the exercise of power is plaine</hi> non sence, <hi>for a mixture in the acts or exercise supposeth a mixture in the principles of action, that is in the very powers: A mixt act proceeding from a simple power, is such Stuffe that I never heard before.</hi> First he saith that <hi>Aristocracy and democracy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50355:80"/> are powers not persons, as well as Monarchy;</hi> and this he taks for granted, vvhich is both an apparent falsity, and a <hi>Solecisme;</hi> for Monarchie, Aristocratie, and Democratie, are neyther povvers, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but formes of Government equally relating to both, the vvordes, according to their etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, noting persons as vvell as povvers; and vvhen these are mixed together it is the mixture of persons, not of povvers, that denominate a mixed forme of Government, as I shall shevv immediatly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he saith that <hi>a mixture in the exercise of power is plaine</hi> non sence <hi>for a mixture in the acts or exercise supposeth a mixture in the principles of action, a mixt act proceeding from a simple povver is such stuffe that I never heard.</hi> Here in stead of lavv he bringeth an <hi>Axiome,</hi> eyther of his ovvne coyning, or taken out of some <hi>Authour</hi> that vvriteth <hi>De causa &amp; causato,</hi> to confirme his mixture; such axioms are no authenticall proofes vvere they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, vvhich for the most part they are not, but admit of divers limitations: it is a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove vvhat kinde of Government is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in any commonwealth, by <hi>Bedas Axiomes,</hi> or the <hi>Axiomes</hi> of any other <hi>Authour;</hi> it had been more seasonable vvhilst he vvas <hi>mixing</hi> the rights of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, if, in making his assertion good, he had <hi>mixed</hi> a little <hi>Law</hi> vvith his <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Logique.</hi> But as his <hi>Axiome</hi> is not authenticall, so vvithout divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions, it is not true; A mixed act may proceed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50355:81"/> from a simple cause, the <hi>Sunne</hi> doth by the same power heate, resolve, and harden, at the same time; for the vertue of naturall Agents is diversly modificated of the subject wherein it is received, and acteth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously according to the severall dispositions thereof. And yet if his <hi>Axiome</hi> were authenticall, or true, it is not pertinent; for what have we to do with mixed acts? the question is, whether the mixture of severall estates in the exercise of some acts of power be not a true mixture, sufficient to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a mixed Government; how doth it follow now that it is no true mixture because a mixed act can not proceed from a simple power? If that were true, yet a mixed forme of Government may proceed from the mixture of severall persons and estates: the division of Government into simple and mixed, is made in respect of the persons, and estates, not of the power, which remains the same under all formes and changes of Government, and can not properly <hi>&amp; per se,</hi> but improperly <hi>&amp; per accidens</hi> be said to be mixed; for it is mixed onely <hi>ad mixtionem subjecti,</hi> when it is seated in a mixed subject, being otherwise the same that it is in a simple: and when a simple forme of Government is changed into a mixed, or a mixed into a simple, the power suffereth not the least alteration, but is denominated simple or mixed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is seated in a simple or mixed subject. This is the Common assertion of all Authours, who do generally teach the diversity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50355:82"/> to arise from the diversity of Persons, their simplicity and mixture, from the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and mixture of Persons, and estates; not from the diversity, or from the simplicity and mixture of powers. <hi>Quoad imperium haud discriminamus spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies rerum publicarum: Siquidem in qualibet Rep. deprehendere est summam legibusque solutam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatem; verum quoad eos penes quos imperium est, differentia reipublicae formarum fieri debet, eoque no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine aut Monarchicus aut Polyarchicus status est, Polyarchicus status aut simplex, aut vero mixtus existit.

We distinguish not the formes of Commonwealths by power, for there is a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power above the lawes in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but the difference ariseth from the persons in whom the power is seated: and in that respect the state of a Commonwealth is eyther Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, or Polyarchicall; the Polyarchicall state is eyther simple or mixed. Now where the severall formes of Government are totally mixed, that is, where the mixture of the thres Estates is both in the power and in the exercise of it, there the simple formes of Government are corrupted, and that which results out of their mixture and corruption is an other forme distinct from them all, which by authours is generally called a <hi>mixed Commonwealth:</hi> this kind of Government is alwayes Polyarchicall, such a mixture being incompatible to Monarchie.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50355:80"/> But where they are but partially mixed that is, where the mixture of the three Estates is in the exercise of power alone, there the simple formes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are not destroyed by such a mixture, but suffer onely an accidentall change. This is a light mixture in comparison of the other, but as great as is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with any of the simple formes of Government; and as true a mixture as the former, which although it doth not totally corrupt, yet it doth manifestly allay the simplicity of a Government: for where severall estates have interest by the constitution of a Government in the exercise of power, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not so simple, as where one of the estates alone have all the interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly that power where the legislative power <label type="milestone">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50355:81"/> shew the invalidity of it: first therefore I answer to the antecedent, that the concurrence of one or both the other Estates with the Monarch in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and promulgation of lawes is no good colour or pretence, much lesse a sufficient ground for such a coordination and mixture as is pressed by them: Although their assents be free, and not depending upon the will of the Monarch, they are not thereby coordinate with him in the rights of Soveraigntie, It is the common assertion of<note n="a" place="margin">Pannor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. cap. gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem de sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commun.</note>

I shall not need to instance in the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, or in other Kingdomes, for it is generally knovvne that such a mixture vvas in that, and hath been, and is, in most other Monarchies. And not onely vvhole representative bodies, but divers particular <hi>free Citties</hi> have the same priviledge; yet have not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authority. In our ovvne Kingdome the Common counsell of every <hi>Incorporation</hi> have authority to make ordinances and constitutions within their ovvne liberties, for the good order and Government of their body. The inhabitants of every <hi>Parish</hi> have authority to make Bylavves and Ordinances amongst themselves for their ovvne profit, vvhere they have custome for it; and for the publique good, vvhere they have no custome.

But if it be for theire owne profit, as for the ordering of their Common, or the like, there without Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome they can not make Bylawes. Why doth not the Treatiser and the pretended Parliamentarians conclude from hence that every man is coordinate with the King in the rightes of Soveraigntie? for this is done by the legislative power, and this authority they have by the constitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>But secondly I answer to the consequent, that the Legislative power is not radically in the three Estates, but in the King alone; for although their assent be free and dependeth not upon his will, yet their authority is derived from him: he should have proved his consequent, which he saith appeareth in the former question, where indeed he doth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirme the whole latitud of the Nomotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power to be jointly in the three estates, yet offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to prove it. But there is scarsly any man in the Kingdome, so much a Strainger to to the lawes, but knows that the King alone hath power to dispence with the Statutes, and to abate their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50355:84"/> vvhere a mischiefe would otherwise insue; that he alone hath power by edicts and proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to order all affaires for vvhich there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken by certaine and perpetuall lavves, that he vvith his judges hath povver to declare the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the lavv, and to give an authentique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to statutes of ambiguous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sence. The King can exercise these and all other partes of the Nomotheticall povver vvhich are of absolute necessity to Governement vvithout the assent of the tvvo houses, vvhose concurrence is onely necessary in making lavves vvhich shall bind posterity, and may not be repealed vvithout the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people, as vvell as of the King. And vvhen such lavves are made it is the Kings authority that givs life unto them, they having othervvise no povver to oblige the conscience then as they are his commands. This hath been sufficiently confirmed already, yet I vvill here further illustrate the truth by the testimonies of<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 9.</note>
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> and the Authour of<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 17.</note>
                  <hi>Fleta,</hi> vvho applying that passage of the civill Lavv, <hi>Quod Principi placet legis habet potestatem,</hi> to the King of England, say, that clause ought not to be understood of every thing that is rashly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be his vvill, but of that vvhich is justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon good advice and deliberation by the councell of his Magistrates, <hi>Rege Authoritatem praestante,</hi> the King giving it authority, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it for a lavv: and from hence by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50355:84"/>
                  <hi>ab indecoro</hi> they shew that the King ought not to doe unjustly, <hi>Cum ipse sit Author juris non debet inde Injuriarum nasci occasio, unde jura nascuntur,</hi> vvhen he Himselfe is the Authour of the lavv, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice ought not to spring from the same fountaine from vvhence the lavv doth spring. The legislative authority is in the King therefore as in its spring and fountaine, and in the other Estates by derivation; they have right and interest in the use and exercise of some partes of the povver, and may assent or dissent vvhat shall be made a lavv, but the povver it selfe is radically in him. Novv the legislative povver is either <hi>Architectonicall</hi> or <hi>preceptive:</hi> the Architectonicall povver is that vvhich layeth the materialls of a lavv, and it consisteth in tvvo things. First, in determining vvhat is just, convenient, or necessary, to be enacted; they to whome this povver is committed, have no jurisdiction granted them, but onely an office and imployment to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and consult. Secondly, in declaring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgating that to be actually made a lavv and enacted, vvhich upon consultation is thought to be just, Convenient, or necessary; they to whom this power is committed, have a jurisdiction granted them to define authoritatively what shall be a law. The preceptive power is that which impresseth a character upon the law that maketh it sacred and inviolable, and which giveth it force to oblige the conscience. It is evident that both partes of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50355:85"/>
                  <hi>Architectonicall</hi> povver is committed to the tvvo houses, they have <hi>votum consultivum &amp; decisivum</hi> both authority to consult vvhat is just, convenient, or necessary; and also to decree vvhat shall be made a lavv: but this authority is derived from the King. It is not much materiall to the present question if it be granted also that they have a Preceptive povver; yet the lavv giveth them not so much. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser in his reply to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> seemeth to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied vvith this answer and doth there dispute against it after this manner, <hi>my second argument</hi> saith he <hi>for radicall mixture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note>
                  <hi>is from the Legislative power being in all three: He answers;</hi> that phrase is satisfied and explained by that concurrence and consent in the exercise of supreame povver. <hi>It seems that invention of his must serve all turnes, is a legislative power satisfied by a bare powerlesse consent? I demande: is that consent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall and authoritative? or meerly consiliarie and un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>authoritative? And whereas I prove that they have an enacting authority by that received and set clause in the beginning of acts;</hi> Be it inacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the authority of the Lordes and Commons assembled in Parliament. <hi>He tell us a vote and power of assenting is a great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I enquire not how great it is: I aske whether that be all; whether that clause, which as expressely as wordes can, asscribs an enacting authority to them, be satisfied by such a power of assenting.</hi> Here are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50355:85"/> many vvordes heaped together, yet not so much as one that toucheth the present controversie: the question is not, whether the two houses have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor yet vvether they have an enacting autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; it is evident they could not sit as judges in the court vvithout authority, nor enact vvithout an ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting authority: but the question is, first, vvhether their enacting authority spoken of in the foresaid clause be onely a povver of assenting that such or such a lavv shall be established, or a povver that Commandeth and giveth life and vigour to the lavves: Secondly, vvhether this povver be radically in themselves or derived from the King.<note place="margin">7. H. 7. 14. &amp; 11. H. 7. 25.</note> To the first I say that it is onely a power of assenting that such or such a law shall be established; for it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the judges that this clause vvhich he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the authority of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons assembled in Parliament,</hi> is no more in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and effect then that vvhich vvas used an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, <hi>The King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lambarts Archeion fol. 271.</note>
                  <hi>with the assent of the Lords and Commons, establisheth,</hi> the vvords <hi>assenteth</hi> and <hi>enacteth</hi> being equivalent in this case. And to the second I say that their authority is derived from the King, not radically in themselves; For although this Treatiser knovvs nor, or vvil not seeme to knovv hovv to put a difference betvveen having an enacting authority, and having the Legislative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50355:86"/> radically in themselves: yet the judges did, and the Statutes doe: For they may enact by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate authority, that is by having the use and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the Legislative povver committed to them so farre as is necessary to that act, although it be not radically in them as their ovvne. But now the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser Speaketh not a vvord to either of these pointes, but sheweth onely that they have an enacting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, vvhich is a point not controverted. For their povver of assenting and laying the materialls of a lavv, is an enacting power, although their activity be not equall to the Kings; Subordinate Agents that are but Instruments of an other, and worke by a derived power, when they concurre vvith the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and supreame Agent have their causality in producing the effect. And therefore vvhereas he demandeth vvhether <hi>their consent be causall and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative, or meerly consiliary and unauthoritative?</hi> I answer that it is as causall and authoritative as if the legislative povver vvere radically in themselves, for he that vvorketh vvith an other mans tooles is as much the cause of the vvorke as if the tooles he useth were his ovvne; vvhether the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by vvhich they enact be the Kings, or radically in themselves, the effect vvill be the same. Novv I confesse it is not expressed in the clause that their <hi>authority</hi> is <hi>derived</hi> from the King, nor is it expressed to be <hi>supreame,</hi> but onely <hi>authority</hi> is attributed to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50355:86"/> them in generall tearmes, as it is also to the Justices, and other delegate and subordinate Ministers in divers Statutes, neyther is it necessary or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that wheresoever the word <hi>authority</hi> is named, it should be defined whether <hi>Supreame</hi> or <hi>derived authority</hi> be meant in that place, for it is expressely declared in divers Statutes that all <hi>authority</hi> is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King, and it is not needfull it should be declared in all.</p>
               <p>It may be further objected that these wordes, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, and the authority of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament</hi> do imply distinct authorities, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King and the authority of the Lordes and Commons; for the addition of these wordes, <hi>And the authority of the Lords, and Commons,</hi> is improper, if lawes be enacted by the Kings authority alone. To this I answer; first, that there is nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent when the King acteth jointly with his subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Ministers, then to asscribe a concurrent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to those that act with him, although their authority be derived from his Majesty: for although his authority can not be seperated from him <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi> as hath been said, yet <hi>cumulativè</hi> it may, that is, it may be inherent in his owne Person, and yet be in others too, as the light of the Sunne is inherent in its owne body, and yet multiplied and diffused through the world; Now when it is separated from him after that manner, it is commonly called their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50355:87"/> authority to whom it is committed, because they are the seat and subject of it. That light which the Starres derive from the Sunne is usually called the light of the Starres, and the Starres are said by the means thereof to concurre with the Sunne, and to have a causality and operation upon inferiour bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; it is no impropriety to say, The light of the Sunne and the light of the Starres inlightneth all the vvorld, although the light of the Starres be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Sunne. The judges have authority by the constitution of the Government to interpret a statute jointly vvith the King, as vvell as the tvvo houses have authority jointly vvith him to make it, so that the King can no more vvithout their assent and concurrence give an authenticall interpretation to a lavv, then he can make it vvithout the assent and concurrence of the other; the exposition of a lavv must be made by the concurrent authority of them both, the authority of the King, and the the authority of the judges; yet no man hath hitherto affirmed the judges to be Supreame, or to have any other authority then what they derive from the King by Commissions, writs, letters patents, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or prescription. But secondly, what if it be granted that the Lords and Commons have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their owne distinct from the Kings authority? To speake my owne opinion freely I think they have a distinct authority. I meane not Supreame authority, but an authority derived from the King, yet distinct
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50355:87"/> from his. He that hath but a delegate power, if it be committed to him for tearme of years, tearme of life or perpetuity, he doth by such a grant acquire an estate in the said power, and an authority distinct from his that gave it him. As in an Estate of landes wherein a man hath a perpetuall right in fee simple, or in fee taile, his right is distinguished from the Kings right of whom he houlds it, the King having the demeane of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the other the demeane of the <hi>Fee:</hi> so it is in an estate of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; if the King granteth an estate of power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and jurisdiction, in fee simple, or in fee taile, for tearme of years, tearme of life, or perpetuity, their rightes in the said authority are distinct, the King hath the demeane of the <hi>Power,</hi> the other the demeane of the <hi>vse,</hi> the King hath <hi>Dominium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectum</hi> the other <hi>Dominium utile.</hi> When one man hath power and authority to use an other mans power and authority, their authorities are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently distinct. And this is the present case; the Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power is wholely and intirely the Kings, yet the Lordes and Commons have a perpetuall right in the use and exercise of some part thereof, so that the King can not actually make a law, except they will also use the authority committed to them, it being in their power to assent or not assent, to use or not to use, the sayd authority. There is an authority then in the Lords and Commons distinct from the Kings authority which must necessarily be put forth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50355:88"/> in the making of lawes, yet not supreame, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the King, derived from him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him. For their authority is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent of it selfe, but dependeth upon the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as the light in the Aire dependeth upon the light in the Sunne, as a shadow dependeth upon the substance, or an accessory upon the principall. But this is more then can be forced out of the foresaid clause, and I thinke more then is intended in it.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly, that Monarchy in which three estates are constituted to the end that the power of the one should moderate and restraine from excesse the power of the other, is mixed in the roote and essence of it, but such is this as is confessed in the answer to the said propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>consequent</hi> must both be denyed; The erection of Courtes, wherein the judges have authority to proceed according to law, notwithstanding the personall and arbitrary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the King, hath alwayes been esteemed a strong and effectuall means to restraine and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the excesses of Monarchie: Yet the judges can not be inferred from hence to be coordinate with the King in the rights of Soveraigntie, or to have a mixed power with him in the Government of the Kingdome. But the <hi>consequent</hi> hath neyther appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nor shadow of truth; Parliaments were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the other estates might consult with the King
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50355:88"/> about the weighty affaires of the Kingdome as often as he thought it needfull, and agree to such lawes as should be found profitable and expedient: not that they should quarrell and contest with him. It is true the two houses do for the most part in time of Parliament gaine an opportunity to have grievances redressed, because they may otherwise deny the King the assistance he desire, but they have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority radically in themselves to doe it; nor were they constituted for that end. If it should be granted that Parliaments are by originall constitution and agreement, and that the People have alwayes given what lawes they pleased to the <hi>Conquerour</hi> as often as the Crowne hath been obteined by <hi>conquest;</hi> yet in probability they could have no such end as this Treatiser imagineth, or to abuse the people, seemeth to imagine: had they purposed the three estates, should moderate the excesses of one another in Parliaments, they would never have granted the King authority to dissolve them at his pleasure, whereby he might easily avoyd and frustrate their intention. Besids Parliaments are so tempered as it is impossible to attaine to that end by such a mixture; one of the estates, or any two of them, having no authority to make an act of Parliament without the third, which way can they moderate the excesses of one another by such acts further then the exorbitant estate shall be willing to be moderated? Nor doth his Majesty, as he imputeth to him, any where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50355:89"/> that <hi>three estates are constituted in this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie to the end that the power of one should mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and restraine from excesse the power of the other,</hi> I am sure his Majestie saith not this <hi>in terminis,</hi> he should therefore have cited his wordes, that the Reader might have judged of their sence.</p>
               <p>These are the objections, brought by the authour of the Treatise of Monarchie which are partly taken out of the fuller Answerer, and partly invented by himselfe. In answering them to avoyd needlesse, Controversies I have granted that a mixed forme of Governement is possible, although I be not ignorant that a mixed Government is but the invention of later times, and reputed impossible by authours of chiefest note. I have admitted also that the King, the Nobility, and Commons, are the three Estates of Parliament, although I know this contrary to the intention of the Statutes, wherin the three Estates of Parliament are declared to be the Cleargie, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the Commons. I have insisted the longer upon these objections because the Authour of the foresaid treatise is esteemed by some the chiefe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of that side. I intend not to derogate from the Authour, who I presume would have written more substantially had the case been capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Yet if a man may gesse at his humour by that treatise, he seemeth to be much more inclined to assert new principles, then to shew reasons how they should be maintained. That he might illude
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50355:89"/> the lawes wherein the Government of England is declared Monarchicall, he laieth downe divers posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this effect, that where a <hi>transcendent interest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part. 1. cap. 4</note> or <hi>primity of share,</hi> is in one man, it is sufficient to constitute a Monarchie, although the other Estates have their shares also in the rightes of Soveraigntie, and supreame authority; but he doth not so much as ofter to prove this either by law, or reason, although it be contrary to the Common received principles of other authours, who teach that such a <hi>trascendent interest</hi> or <hi>primity of share</hi> can not make a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.<note place="margin">Besold.

But yet if his new principles were granted to be true, he can not by such shiftes in any plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner evade the Statutes, wherein the King is declared to have intire, whole, and plenary power, and to be so supreame that all authority is derived from him, and wherein it is declared that all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due to him, and to him onely: vvill a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent interest make good all this? is a Primity of Share intire, vvhole and plenary povver? can all authority be derived from him that hath but an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most chiefly? is all obedience due to one of the Estates, vvhere the mixture is in the povver it selfe, and supreame authority radically in the other? Surely if the other Estates have povver, alleagiance and obedience is due unto it; they had as good challenge no povver, as challenge no obedience.</p>

               <head type="sub">Divers generall objections taken from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his <hi>Majesty, Bracton,</hi> and <hi>Fortescue,</hi> together with the presidents of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the second, answered.</head>
               <p>BEsids the former objections they urge the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> of <hi>Bracton,</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescue;</hi> to vvhich I ansvver in generall, that the decision of this controversy depends upon lavv, and not upon the bare wordes and authority of any. The vvordes of Lavvyers are to be regarded no further then they are approved by lavv; for they are but men, and may be incited by passion or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50355:91"/> interest to speak or vvrit vvhat they ought not. I have therefore purposely my selfe omitted all proofes of that nature, and although I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>catalogue</hi> of Lavvyers longer then a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie</hi> to confirme the Kings right, yet I have cited none but such as prove what they say by the lawes, except onely those that are cited by themselves, which I had also omitted, but that I desire to make it evident how farre those Authours are from favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their seditious opinions. And if his <hi>Majesty</hi> out of a desire to avoyd the effusion of blood used such gracious expressions as vvere most likely to prevayle vvith the people, and consolidate their mindes, they ought not in equity to prejudice the rightes of the Crovvne, although he had abdicated therein some parte of his authority, and granted things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to his ovvne prerogative. I have given this generall answer not because his <hi>Majesty, Bracton,</hi> or <hi>Fortescue</hi> have affirmed any thing in favour of their right, but to shew the insufficiency of this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in case they had; but the truth is they have notoriously perverted the meaning of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> as also the meaning of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fortescue.</hi> And although I can not Imagine any man so sencelesse as to beleeve his <hi>Majesty</hi> ever subscribed to their judgement; or any that have perused the works of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fortescue</hi> so voyd of understanding as to thinke they were ever abettors of such phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: yet that they may not exclaime for want of an
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50355:91"/> answer I vvill more particularly examine vvhat they say.</p>
               <p>Out of his <hi>Majesties</hi> answer to the nineteene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions they alledge this passage. <hi>There being three kinds of Government amongst men, absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and all these having their particular conveniences and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, the experience and wisdome of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, hath so moulded this out of a mixture of these, as to give to this Kingdome (as farre as humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can provide) the conveniences of all three, without the in conveniences of any one, as long as the ballance hangs even between the three estates, and they run jointly on in their proper channell (begetting verdure and fertility, in the moddowes on both sides and the overflowing of eyther, on eyther side raise no deluge or inundation); the ill of absolute Monarchie is Tyranny; the ill of Aristocracie is faction and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; the ills of Democracie are tumults, violence, and licenciousnesse. The good of Monarchie is the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a nation under one head, to resist invasion from abroad, and insurrection at home; the good of Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy is the conjunction of Councell in the ablest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a state for the publik benefit; the good of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie is libertie and the courage and industry which libertie begets — the Lords being trusted with a judicatory power, are an excellent screen and banke between the prince and people — by just judgements to preserve the law, since — therefore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50355:92"/> the power legally placed in both houses is more then sufficient to prevent and restraine the power of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny — since to the power of punishing, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in your handes according to law.</hi> Thus farre, and in this manner, his <hi>Majesty</hi> is cited by the fuller Answerer, who that he might the better wrest his <hi>Majesties</hi> Speeches to his owne purpose, hath made many transitions from one place to another, mutilating the sence, and leaving out that which should have made his <hi>Majesties</hi> meaning appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.<note place="margin">Answer to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> pag. 3.</note> And from these wordes he maketh divers <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions;</hi> his <hi>first deduction</hi> is, that his Majesty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Government of England to be mixed in the power it selfe, this he inferreth because his Majesty acknowledgeth a <hi>mixture,</hi> and it is no true mixture he saith, which <hi>is not in the very supreamacy of power it selfe;</hi> but this is answered in the former chapter: I shall here onely desire the reader to take notice that his <hi>Majesties</hi> true and reall intention is such as I have their expounded; for these wordes, <hi>The good of Monarchie is the uniting a Nation under one Head,</hi> are a perfect Comentarie upon the former, and doe clearely manifest that his <hi>Majesty</hi> asserted not the Head and seat of supreame power to be a mixed subject, but granted a Mixture in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of power alone. His <hi>second deduction</hi> is that the King granteth the power of interpreting,<note place="margin">Reply to Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> pag. 34.</note> and giving finall judgement of the sence of law, to be in the two houses, this he concludeth to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50355:92"/> meaning when he saith, <hi>The Lords being trusted with a judicatory power, are an excellent screen and banke between the King and People by just judgements to preserve the law.</hi> But this they may doe without having a power of interpretation and giving finall judgement of the sence of law; It is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that they have a power to interpret law <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> in such cases as are cogniscible in the court, when they are brought before them, although they have no power to interpret it <hi>authoritatively,</hi> and to rule all cases as they please. This is a great Savegard to the people, and as convenient and fit a remedy against oppression as humane prudence can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, for a certaine and infallible remedy against all mischiefs they can not have: if the two houses had a power to declare what they would to be law, what screen should the people have against their oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? what bankes to hinder the irruption of their tyranny? whereas now they have a remedy by law against the evill instruments of the King, and may repaire their losses by a legall tryall, what remedy could they have against the misimplyed agents of the houses? Such a povver placed in them, vvould not make them a <hi>Screen</hi> or <hi>banke</hi> betvveen the Prince and people, but a <hi>Rocke</hi> and <hi>precipice,</hi> dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fatall to them both; and vvould be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true interest of the Kingdome, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is to his <hi>Majesties</hi> true intention. But the best of all is that he inferreth from the vvordes above
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50355:93"/> said both the houses to have a power of declaring lavv, for vvhereas his <hi>Majesty</hi> in the premisses speaks onely of the house of Lords, by a trike of more then <hi>Presbyterian Legerdemaine</hi> he hath jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the house of Commons into his inference. His <hi>third deduction</hi> is that his Majesty granteth the tvvo houses a povver of forcible resistance in case they should judge his actions tyrannicall and unjust; this he collecteth out of these vvords <hi>since — therefore the power legally placed in both houses is more then sufficient to prevent and restraine the power of tyranny.</hi> This he says can not be made good unlesse the houses have a povver of resistance; for tyranny can not be othervvise restrained. But it is evident that his Majesty speaks not in this place of a forcible, but of a legall vvay of restrainte; <hi>Id possit quisquam quod jure possit,</hi> Every man is said to have a povver to doe that vvhich he can doe by lavv, although he may be hindered in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. His Majesty grants them not an absolute povver of restraining tyranny, but let that be taken in vvhich goeth immediatly before, and his vvordes vvill beare no other sence but that they have a povver of restraining it, so farre as humane prudence can by lavvfull and just vvayes provide: as for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible resistance his Majesty knevv it to be against the lavv of God, and that to invest the pretended houses vvith such a povver, vvas not the vvay to pull dovvne, but to set up tyranny. Neyther is forcible
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50355:93"/> resistance a more certaine means of restraining ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny then other legall vvayes lesse corrasive, if the houses had a povver of resistance, they are not sure alvvayes to prevaile, a tyrant and his evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments may be able sometimes to oppose them, and to hinder the execution of their povver: it is not convenient therefore they should have such a povver, it is better to tolerate a mischiefe then to use a remedy vvhich is vvorse then the disease, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine too. But they have by lavv a double povver as effectuall as forcible resistance, they may inflict exemplary punishment upon evill instruments, vvhereby others may be affraid to take upon them such imployments, and they may refuse to give the King subsidies and other necessary assistance, if he refuseth to moderate his excesses; If a tyrant and his evill instruments be strong and in no necessity, vvere it lavvfull to resist and to levy vvarre against them, the successe vvould be doubtfull, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage certaine: and if the best happen they should but cure the commonvvealth of an <hi>Ague</hi> by giving if the <hi>Plauge;</hi> but if he be necessitated eyther by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections, or othervvise, to crave the assistance of his subjects, they shall then have liberty to execute their povver upon his evill instruments, or to make use of any other means the lavv hath put into their handes. Where tyranny reignes such opportunities vvill in a short time assuredly be offered; the best Princes can not alvvayes suppresse rebellions
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50355:94"/> by the helpe of their loyall subjects, how much lesse can tyrants be able to do it without them. Such exigencies being considered, I say the power legally placed in the houses is more then sufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine tyranny, without a power of resistance.</p>

                  </label> Themselves will not admit the house of Lords alone to be superiour to the King, and yet these words can have reference to no other; for the house of Commons consists not of Earles and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, neyther are they a court of judicature. It is otherwise also evident that <hi>Bractons</hi> scope and meaning can not be such as they would fasten on him, who, when he speaketh of this subject, doth every where resolve the contrary, whereof the places above cited are sufficient instances. The wordes therefore can not relate to a legall supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the person of the King, but to a morall superiority over his conscience, and they imply onely that the King in governing the people hath God, the law, and the house of Earles and Barons morally above him, by whose admonitions and judgements, so farre as they are legall, he ought in conscience to be swayed. I well set downe the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50355:94"/> whole and intire Period, with that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before hath reference to it, and let the Reader Judge of the sence. <hi>Nec factum Regis nec chartam potest quis judicare, ita quod factum Domini Regis irritetur. Sed dicere poterit quis, quod Rex justitiam fecerit, &amp; bene, &amp; si hoc eadem ratione quod male, &amp; ita imponere ei quod injuriam emendet, ne incidat Rex &amp; justic. in judicium viventis Dei propter injuriam Rex autem habet superiorem Deum. S. item legem per quam factus est Rex, item Curiam suam, vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet Comites, Barones, quia Comites dicuntur quasi Socii Regis, &amp; qui habet socium habet Magistrum, &amp; ideo si Rex fuerit sine froeno.</hi> 1. <hi>sine lege, debent ei froe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ponere.</hi> If these wordes be well considered it will be cleare that nothing but a morall superiority can here be understood; first, he saith that no man hath authority to judge of the Kings fact, or of his Charter, <hi>Nec factum Regis nec Chartam potest quis judicare.</hi> This can not stand with a legall superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; if the Earles and Barons can not judge of the Kings fact, or of his charter, they can not have a legall superiority over him. Secondly, he saith some notwithstanding, in case justice be not duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, may advertise him thereof, and admonish him to reforme his errours, <hi>Sed dicere poterit quis quod Rex justiciam fecerit, &amp; bene, &amp; si hoc, eadem ratione quod male, &amp; ita imponere ei quod injuriam emendet.</hi> thirdly he sheweth that the Earles and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in Parliament have this authority, who, if they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50355:95"/> see him breake out into violent and illegall Courses, ought to put a bridle of the law upon him, <hi>Rex au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem hvbet superiorem Deum. S. item legem per quam factus est Rex, item Curiam suam videlicet Comites &amp; Barones,</hi> &amp;c. But the whole tenour and effect of the wordes import that they ought to put upon him a bridle of law by faire and gentill means, as by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, advertisments, councell, or any such other way as the law prescribs, and not like judges by force and compulsion. Fourthly, he saith <hi>the King hath God his superiour, and the law, and the Earles and Barons in his court:</hi> he maketh no distinction of superiority, but calleth them all superiour after the same manner, now it is evident that God doth not exercise a legall superiority over Kings, and that the law being inanimate can not; both of them have onely a morall influence upon their consciences, and therefore those words must be interpreted onely of a morall superiority. It is true after his death God shall dispose of him as his judge, but <hi>Bracton</hi> in thise place speaketh of giving present judgement upon his fact and upon his patents, according to humane lawes, which how illegall soever can not be judged by any: yet he saith God, the law, and the Earles and Barons in his court are Morally above him, by whose counsels and admonitions he ought to amend his excesses. Fiftly he giveth this reason why they are his superiours <hi>because they are his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and he that hath a Companion hath a master,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50355:95"/> this</hi> is true of a <hi>Morall Master</hi> but not of a <hi>Legall;</hi> all <hi>Companions</hi> can not <hi>Legally</hi> be one anothers <hi>Masters,</hi> but Morally they may. The vvhole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the vvords, but especially this reason doth make it cleare that they are meant of a Morall supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, so that if the whole period be taken in, this passage of <hi>Bracton</hi> maketh not for them, but against them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they alleadge the testimony of <hi>Fortescue,</hi> who speaking of the King of <hi>England,</hi> saith, <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patu ne dum Regali sed &amp; Politico suo populo domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> That is, <hi>He governeth his people not onely by Kingly, but also by politique power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fortescue</hi> implyeth in these wordes that the King ought not to make his will, but the lawes the rule of his power; not that others are coordinate with him in the rights of Soveraigntie. For <hi>Imperium</hi> is eyther <hi>Despoticum</hi> or <hi>Politicum; Despoticall</hi> or <hi>Kingly power</hi> is an arbitrary and unlimited power, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by humane lawes and constitutions; <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique power</hi> is a limited povver, restrained and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by humane and politique lavves. Novv <hi>Fortescue</hi> saith that the Kings <hi>power</hi> is not meerly <hi>Despoticall</hi> and <hi>Regall,</hi> but <hi>Politique</hi> and tempered by law; and his intention is to shew the difference between the common lawes of England, and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill law; by the civill lawes the Emperour after the power was translated to him from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by that law which in the <hi>Digest</hi> is called <hi>lex
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50355:96"/> regia,</hi> untill the custome of making lawes by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people tooke place againe, might Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what he pleased, <hi>Quod Principi placet legis habet potestatem,</hi> is a part of that lavv; but the King of England, he saith, can not altogether govern his people by such a power, but is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to rule them according to the tenour of the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique</hi> lawes and constitutions of the Kingdome. But how doth this concerne the case in hand?</p>

               <p>THey have yet other objections whereby they endeavour to prove that the Particular rightes of Soveraigntie are divided from the King and placed in the two houses. And first tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Militia,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> and the <hi>reverent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> have found a device how the two houses may make use of <hi>that,</hi> and levy vvarre against the King by his owne authority. They say as judges they may send out <hi>Messengers</hi> or <hi>Sergeants at armes</hi> for his evill counsellours, and in case they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50355:97"/> refuse to appeare before them, fetch them in as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents by force of armes; this is the summe of their objection, but I will set it downe in their owne <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>1</label> tearmes. <hi>Suppose,</hi> saith Mr. Bridge, <hi>a man be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the Parliament for some notorious crime, it is granted by all that the Parliament hath a power to send a</hi> Sergeant at armes <hi>for him, and if he refuse to come that Sergeant at armes hath a power to call more and if the Delinquent shall rayse twenty or thirty or an hundred men to reskue him, then the Parliament hath power to send downe more</hi> Messengers <hi>by force to bring up the Delinquent, and if they may rayse an hundred, why may they not upon the like occasion rayse a thousand and so ten thousand?</hi> And againe in his answer to Doctor <hi>Ferns</hi> reply. <hi>If the Parliament may send one</hi> Sergeant at armes, <hi>then</hi> 20. <hi>then an hundred then a housand.</hi> This I confesse is a very acute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, for there can be by law but thirty <hi>Sergeants at armes</hi> at the same time within the Realme;<note place="margin">13. R. 2. cap. 6.</note> novv if Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> can shew the two houses a way how out of thirty <hi>Sergeants at armes</hi> they may rayse an army of a thousand, or ten thousand, his invention will be worthy to be applauded. The <hi>reverent Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> have in substance the same objection saving onely they are not so punctuall for point of lavv as to have their army consist of <hi>Sergeants at armes;</hi> and they alleadge a case in law to justify that way of proceeding. <hi>Supposing,</hi> say they, <hi>the power of calling and dissolving Parliaments wholly in the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50355:97"/> yet there may be such power in them so long as they do sit to command armes to be raysed for the suppressing of any delinquents, maintaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with armes even under the colour of the Kinges authority, which I thuse make good. If there be any such kinde of power in the very judges in their courtes at Westminster, for the whole Kingdome, and in their severall circuits for the shires they sit in, although themselves are made judges at the Kinges will meerly, and put out ordinarily at his pleasure, and they can neyther keepe assizes at any time, nor keepe any tearme any where, but when and so longe as the King pleases to give commission: If (I say) there be such a power in the judges and even in one of them then much more in the whole Parliament, which is unquestionably and undoubtedly the highest judicature in the Kingdome, and hath most power during their sitting, now that such a kinde of power is in the Iudges I appeale to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the case followinge. A privat man hath a suite with the King about lande or house and the like, the Kinge hath possession and some officer or tenant of his holds it for the Kinge, the judges ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the cause give sentence for the subject, ad judge him to have the possession delivered him by the Kinges tenant or officer; he refuses and armes himself to keepe possession still upon thise, after due summons and processe of law a write of rebellion shall goe out against the officer of the Kinges even though he should pretend to keepe possession still by a command
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50355:98"/> and warrant from the King and the Sheriffe shall be commanded to rayse armes even the whole</hi> posse Comitatus <hi>if need be to expell this officer of the Kinges and bring him to condigne punishment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistinge the Kings authority in his lawes. Here now is raysinge of armes by the Kings legall authority, against the Kings title, and the Kings officer notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any pretended authority from the Kinges per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall command, and that officer hath a writ of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion sent against him, and shall be punished by law, for offering to resist the law upon any pretence (aske the lawers whether in sence this be not the law, and ordinarily prastised, save that the Kinge do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande the contrary, but whether that would hinder law or not?) the Parliament may then in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity rayse armes against the Kings personall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the generall safty and keeping possession (which is more necessary then the hope of regaining) of the houses, landes, goodes, liberties, lives, religion and all, and this by the Kings legall authority, and the resisters of this are the Rebells in the lawes account, and not the instruments so imployed legally, though vvith armes by the Parliament.</hi>

                  </label> For matter of fact, it vvas themselves that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Delinquents from a legall tryall, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained none; but when divers members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were assaulted in the streets, driven from the house, defamed by libells, and justice not permitted to take place, it was the office of the King to protect
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50355:98"/> them in their rights and liberties, and to force the due execution of the lawes: and if he refused to yeald up those to their injustice which assisted him, this vvas not to keep Delinquents from their tryall, but to protect his loyall subjects according to lavv; this for matter of fact. But for matter of right, suppose the King had taken up armes unjustly, the lavv doth not permit his courtes to oppose him, or to call any in question that are assistant to him: vvhen the King taketh up armes they vvhich attend upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">11. H. 7. cap. 1.</note> or are imployed in other places about the same service, may not be molested or troubled by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of lavv, or suffer any losse and dammage in their estates for it, eyther by act of Parliament, or otherwise. As for their objection it is so full of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious passages and mistakes that I must let most of them goe untouched; first, they assume the two houses to be the vvhole Parliament; Secondly, they assume them to be a court of judicature; thirdly they assume the judges to have a povver of suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any delinquents, and maintaining themselves by armes: The tvvo former assumptions are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false, and the latter true onely in some cases, so farre as they have order of lavv; and no man deny such a povver to be in the two houses they may force delinquents to appeare before them in such cases, and in such a manner as the lavv hath provided; for vvhat is so done is done by the Kings authority, vvhose commands in lavv are to be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50355:99"/> obeyed before his personall commands. But they must proceed no further, nor after any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the King commands in lavv; neyther they, nor the judges, can make vvhat ordinances they please to rayse armes, or imploy their owne instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring in delinquents, but must proceed according to order of law, and commit the whole carriage of the buisinesse to such of the King offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as are appointed for that purpose, which are chiefly the high <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of counties, who are also confined by law, and may not exceed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. For both in the case put by the <hi>reverent Divines,</hi> and also in all cases whatsoever, if Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents grow so strong that they be able to resist the <hi>posse Commitatus,</hi> and can not be suppressed but by a warre, and by the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> ought then to certify the court thereof, and the prosecution of the matter must be left to the King, to whom onely it is reserved to preserve the peace of the Kingdome in such cases.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>2</label> Secondly they urge the oath taken by the King at his coronation against his <hi>Negative voyce,</hi> vvhereby they say he is bound to give his assent to all bills offered him by the Lordes and Commons. The pretended houses in one of their <hi>Declarations</hi> have set dovvne a forme in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine vvhich they say vvas anciently used, and ought novv to be taken, <hi>concedis justas leges &amp; consuetudines esse tenendas, &amp; promittis pro te eas

               <p>If their glosse upon the said oath were authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, yet an other forme hath been long in use, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are divers <hi>Presidents</hi> upon <hi>Record,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King is sworne to uphould and maintaine the lavves and customes onely that are actually then in use when he taketh the said oath, not such as shall be offered him by the houses. The oath taken by his Majesty was this.</p>
               <p>BISHOPE. <hi>Sir will you grant to hould and keepe the lavves and rightfull customes, vvhich the commonalty of this your Kingdoms have, and vvill you defend and uphould them, to the honour of God so much as in you lyeth</hi>
               </p>
               <p>KING. <hi>I grant and promise so to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it vvere the custome anciently to take such an oath as they alleadge, that custome is now abrogated and other formes are upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, vvhich have been taken successively by many Kings together, and ought now to take place. Let not the Commons if they love their ovvne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest plead to have all ancient customes revived. But secondly I say, that there was never such a custome;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50355:100"/> In the time of Henry the third the Kings oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined onely these three things.<note place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acton <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Now if the houses could shevv (which I beleeve they can not) that divers Kings have taken the foresaid oath, or any other bearing such a sence as they impose upon it, that is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove a custome seeing the practise was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and is at the present otherwise. Thirdly if it be granted them that the sayd forme ought novv to be used, yet it vvill not admit of such an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they have given it; the vvorde <hi>Lawes</hi> in the oath can not be understood of those lavves vvhich shall afterwards be offered the King by the tvvo houses in Parliament, for that clause, <hi>quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> can not be applied to the house of Lords. Fourthly let it be yet further granted that the above said forme ought to be taken, and that the sence of it is such as they interpret, yet they bind him not to assent to all lawes, but onely to those that are just, and so farre he is bound in conscience to assent without an oath, and to that end he is assisted in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50355:100"/> by his justices, and councell at lavv, vvho ought to in forme him, where he wanteth informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what are the rightes of the Crowne, vvhat the liberties of the people, that so he might be the better able to determine what is fit to be passed, and what is fit to be denyed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly some inferre that the King hath not a <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>3</label> povver of dissenting, from the usuall answer vvhich he giveth vvhen he refuseth to passe a bill, <hi>Le Roy s' adviserâ,</hi> wherin they say <hi>he doth not perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deny his assent, but onely craveth time to deliberate upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To vvhat purpose should he crave time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate about that which can not be avoyded, <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>If I should give a Particular ansvver to all their <hi>Presidents</hi> I should weary the Reader with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> sometimes they alleadge a seditious speech of some of the Members for an act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; sometimes they say such or such a thing was done by act of Parliament, and cite an Authour in the Margent, whereas no such thing is to be found in the said Authour; Sometimes they urge a <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> where in the houses denied to give the King
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50355:101"/> such subsidies and assistance, as he required to his warres, because the said warres were undertaken vvithout their assent, and conclude from thence that the povver of making warre and treating with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine states belong to the tvvo houses, vvhen the reason of their denyall vvas the miscarriages of the vvarre, and the misimployment of former subsidies, not that they challenged the power of making warre or treating vvith forraine states to pertaine unto them. But supposing all that they say true, and all their <hi>Presidents</hi> pertinent, I shall make these tvvo generall ansvvers; first, I say, that if the King, as in conscience he vvas bound, did at the request of the houses discharge divers corrupt officers, and substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute others into their places, or if upon just reasons and motives in the vacancy of an office he disposed of it by the assent and approbation of the two houses, or ordered his warre by their advice and direction, this doth not argue them to have a right in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the said officers, or that the carriage and conduct of the warre depended upon their assent: if the King at any time hath given vvay to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires it vvas a voluntary and free act of grace, not an obligation of law. Secondly, I say, that if such a right as is pretended vvere placed in them by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, such acts by the common lavv of the land were voyd, for the rights of the Crowne are setled upon it by the fundamentall lavves, as hath been shewed, and can not be separated by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50355:101"/> These are all the objections vvhich could vvithout violence be referred to this place; The rest which depende not upon lavv shall be ansvvered in the other questions, if any thing be omitted that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to justify their cause, let any man undertake to answer me, and give me notice of it, and I doubt not but I shall be able, through the assistance of God, to make a full and satisfactory reply unto him. And this I shall desire of my Adversary, that vvhen he maketh use of any authority he vvould cite the wordes at large, as I my selfe have done in all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall pointes, and not make references onely in the Margent, that the Reader may judge of the scope and intention thereof, and be able to discerne which of us dealeth faithfully, and which of us ingaged by faction strive to illude the lawes, and wrest them from their genuine and native sence.</p>
               <p>And thuse by the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God I have in part discharged my conscience, being bound by all the bonds both of divine and humane lavves to oppose and withstand, as farre I am able, the false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and principles, which <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>sheeps cloathing</hi> indeavour dayly to infuse into mens minds. I shall easily avoyd, I presume, the usuall calumny incident to those which write upon this subject, as namely, that under the pretext of promoting the Apostles doctrine of obedience, they intende by flattering Princes, to promote their ovvne private interest. I vvould to God the condition of his Majesty and the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50355:102"/> Kingdome vvere such as they might have some colour to lay that imputation upon me. But I am not ignorant that I might Sooner have advanced my owne interest by adoring the <hi>pretended Parliament,</hi> vvho dispose of all mens estates and fortunes at their pleasure, pretending as much right to all his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Kingdomes,<note place="margin">Luke 4.6.</note> and to all the povver and glory thereof; as the <hi>Divell</hi> did to all the Kingdomes in the world. <hi>For that,</hi> say the Members, <hi>is delivered unto us, and to whomesoever we will, we give it,</hi> And I know they use to distribute their favours liberally to those that will <hi>fall downe and worshipe them.</hi> But how poore soever my condition is, I have no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to buy my interest at so deare a rate; I had rather perish in the performance of my duty then be confederate to their Sacriledge, and other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, or not render my country that service which I owe it, for whose liberty I would willingly Sacrifice not onely my owne interest, but my life. I should be no good <hi>English man</hi> if I did not desire a better subject to discourse upon then the miseries of the Kingdome, and if by being silent and turning away mine eyes, I could help to quench the flame that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datious and factious Spirits have Kindled in it, I should have abstained from writing at this time: But the danger and miserable condition of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth calls for action to all those, which had not rather see all thinges managed according to the appetite of those <hi>Incendiaries</hi> and <hi>Firebrands of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
